H4NZPZ5D;journalArticle;2020;"Lanham, BS; Poore, AGB; Gribben, PE";Facilitation cascades create a predation refuge for biodiversity in a novel connected habitat;ECOSPHERE;;2150-8925;10.1002/ecs2.3053;;Communities structured via facilitation cascades whereby one habitat-forming species promotes a secondary habitat-forming species with synergistic effects on biodiversity are increasingly documented. Habitat-formers can also extend the realized niche of other habitat-forming species by facilitating their recruitment into novel environments across heterogeneous landscapes. However, further understanding of whether secondary habitat-formers in these novel environments differ in their structure or support different communities from those settled in their natal habitat is required. Here, we investigated whether abiotic and biotic conditions in a novel connected habitat influence biodiversity within a secondary habitat-former facilitated outside its natal habitat. We contrasted the morphology of the habitat-forming alga, Sirophysalis trinodis, and its associated fish and epifaunal community occurring on rocky reef (natal habitat) and on nearby a biogenic hard substrate, live clam shells (novel habitat) in soft sediments. The algae on clams had a different morphology to those on the rocky shore and supported increased abundance of some epifaunal species. A reciprocal transplant experiment of S. trinodis individuals among habitats found that differences in the abundance of epifauna were explained by the increased abundance and consumption rates of predatory fish on the reef habitat compared to soft-sediment habitats, and not by differences in algal morphology between habitats. We demonstrate that facilitation promotes a secondary habitat-former into a novel habitat, which then enhances the abundance of associated epifauna by providing a predation refuge. This study contributes to a small but growing body of research demonstrating landscape-scale effects of facilitation cascades, and that basal habitat-formers can extend the realized niche of secondary habitat-formers and their associated communities.;2020-04;2023-07-04 07:30:46;2024-07-15 15:17:37;;;;4;11;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000536583400019;;;;;;"foundation species; biodiversity; predation; community structure; structural complexity; facilitation cascade; MARINE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; FISH ASSEMBLAGES; COLONIZATION; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; KEY ROLE; ORGANIZATION; POSITIVE INTERACTIONS; SEAGRASS BEDS; STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The hypothesis was that the impact on L. conchilega would be minimal, but that the fauna benefiting from the biogenically structured habitat would be impacted by beam-trawling. In this study, the impact of beam-trawl passage on intertidal L. conchilega reefs and its associated fauna was quantified. A treatment zone was exposed to a one-off experimental trawling. Subsequently, the impact on and recovery of the associated fauna was investigated for a period of 9 days post-impact. Community analysis showed a clear impact followed by a relatively quick recovery as apparent through MDS analysis (stress 0.06), a significant (p < 0.001) IMS of 0.61, through ANOSIM analysis: significant (p = 0.001) dissimilarities between treatment and control and through SIMPER analysis (decreasing dissimilarities over time). This impact and subsequent recovery was largely explained by two species: Eumida sanguinea and Urothoe poseidonis. Species analysis confirmed the beam-trawl passage significantly (P = 0.001) impacted E. sanguinea for the whole period of the experiment. The experiment confirmed that closely associated species of L. conchilega reefs are impacted by beam-trawl fisheries. This small-scale intertidal study provides some pointers which indicate that the tightly associated species will be impacted significantly when beam-trawling L. conchilega reefs in subtidal areas.

Theory and empirical research predict that greater habitat structural complexity will generally result in higher abundance, richness, and diversity of epifaunal species. We evaluated the impact of a recently introduced, structurally complex bryozoan, Watersipora subtorquata, by comparing its associated epifaunal communities with those of primary substrate, other habitat modifiers (tunicates and mussels), and structurally similar mimics. Community composition differed between Watersipora and other treatments for both mobile and sessile epifaunal communities, but species richness and diversity were significantly higher on Watersipora for mobile animals only. Differences in mobile community composition and diversity were driven by polychaete worms, which were found in greater abundance and higher diversity in Watersipora. Crustaceans, although equally abundant, were more evenly distributed across treatments. Sessile epifaunal communities differed little in richness or abundance among treatments, suggesting that while Watersipora provides biogenic surfaces for colonization that adequately compensate for the primary substrate it exploits, its high structural complexity does not correspond to an increase in sessile epifaunal abundance relative to less complex habitat modifiers. Our results suggest that neutral or facilitative effects of exotic species may be common; the strength and direction of the impact of a novel habitat-forming species on epifaunal communities will depend on the quality of the resource it provides, the strength of ecological interactions between habitat-forming species and epifauna, epifaunal habitat preferences, and whether habitat is a limiting resource for a particular species or group.";2010;2023-07-04 07:30:48;2024-04-11 09:22:50;;69-80;;;398;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000273968500005;;;;;;"Habitat complexity; Epifauna; Watersipora subtorquata; Exotic species; Habitat engineer; IMPACTS; DIVERSITY; SEAWEED; COMPETITION; REEF; COMPLEXITY; FACILITATION; INVASION; MARINE COMMUNITIES; PREDATOR; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Such differentials were investigated at four disparate localities in a bay lacking the callianassid bioturbation of other local sites. Here there were no such marked or consistent differences: <50% of differentials were statistically significant, with seagrass showing the lower, not higher, level in half of those. Overall, faunal abundance was lower in seagrass in the ratio of 0.64 : 1, whilst species density was higher but only by 1.13 to 1. Seagrass assemblages at a given locality were more similar to those of the adjacent bare sand than they were to seagrass assemblages at other localities, and likewise in respect of those in the bare sand. This suggests that marked differentials, where they occur, may result not from any supposed favourability of seagrass as a habitat but from the operation of processes within the unvegetated-sediment compartment of the system.

In the Gulf of Mexico, black mangroves (Avicennia germinans) are expanding northward into salt marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora (hereafter Spartina). Salt marshes are essential habitats for many organisms, including ecologically and economically important species such as blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) and Penaeid shrimp (e.g., Penaeus aztecus), which may be affected by vegetation changes. Black mangroves occupied higher tidal elevations than Spartina, and Spartina was present only at its lowest tidal elevations in sites when mangroves were established. We compared nekton and infaunal communities within monoculture stands of Spartina that were bordered by mangroves to nearby areas where mangroves had not yet become established. Nekton and infaunal communities were significantly different in Spartina stands bordered by mangroves, even though salinity and temperature were not different. Overall abundance and biomass of nekton and infauna was significantly higher in marshes without mangroves, although crabs and fish were more abundant in mangrove areas. Black mangrove expansion as well as other ongoing vegetation shifts will continue in a warming climate. Understanding how these changes affect associated species is necessary for management, mitigation, and conservation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we test whether the localised expansion of a native habitat-forming macroalga, Cauleipa filiformis, on subtidal reefs can affect the abundance of fauna associated with a neighbouring macroalgal habitat. C filiformis was a functionally distinct habitat for fauna, and the total abundance of epifauna associated with the resident alga, Sargassum lineartfolium, was reduced at some sites when in close proximity to or surrounded by C filiformis. Experimental manipulation of habitat configuration demonstrated that the low abundance of gastropods on S. linearifolium when surrounded by C filiformis was likely explained by C filiformis acting as a physical dispersal barrier for mobile fauna. Changes to the spatial configuration of novel and resident habitats can thus affect the abundance of fauna in addition to the direct replacement of habitats by species undergoing range expansions or increasing in abundance.

AC894SKB;journalArticle;2018;"Gabara, SS; Hamilton, SL; Edwards, MS; Steller, DL";Rhodolith structural loss decreases abundance, diversity, and stability of benthic communities at Santa Catalina Island, CA;MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES;;0171-8630;10.3354/meps12528;;Species that increase habitat structural complexity often have a disproportionate influence on their ecosystems. Rhodoliths are bed-forming unattached coralline algae which increase benthic structural complexity and enhance biodiversity in coastal soft-bottomed ecosystems worldwide. Consequently, their degradation due to anthropogenic disturbance, such as crushing from boat mooring chains, may lead to reduced biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. To examine how anthropogenic disturbance impacts rhodolith community dynamics, we used a comprehensive sampling and analytical approach to compare macroalgal, invertebrate (infauna and epifauna), and fish assemblages between rhodolith beds and adjacent mooring-disturbed crushed rhodolith sand. Sampling was conducted during 2 sampling times across 3 sites at Catalina Island, CA, USA. Our results demonstrate that the more heterogeneous structure provided in less disturbed rhodolith beds supported greater community richness and abundances than crushed rhodolith sands. Specifically, disturbance-related rhodolith structural loss was associated with significantly reduced richness of invertebrates and abundance of macroalgae, invertebrates, and fish. In particular, deposit-feeding infaunal tanaids were far more abundant in rhodolith beds and drove much of the difference in invertebrate abundance between habitats. Further, spatiotemporal variation in the infaunal invertebrate assemblages was 54 % lower in the rhodolith beds than crushed rhodolith sand, suggesting that rhodolith beds support more stable communities. Our results suggest that structured rhodolith bed habitats support more abundant, diverse, and stable benthic communities than do disturbed rhodolith sand habitats. Better management of rhodolith ecosystems and the factors that disturb them could help maintain coastal biodiversity and stability.;2018-05-14;2023-07-04 07:30:55;2024-01-29 10:27:35;;71-88;;;595;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000432551900006;;;;;;"Community structure; Coralline algae; Foundation species; Habitat complexity; Disturbance; Maerl; Rhodolith; BIODIVERSITY; GROWTH; CALIFORNIA; CONSEQUENCES; HABITAT; FISH; ASSEMBLAGES; MAERL BEDS; SCALLOPS AEQUIPECTEN-OPERCULARIS; MANGROVES; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Here, we explore the diversity and abundance of marine macrobenthos across three gulfs of the Cuban Archipelago and examine the role of habitat type in determining faunal composition and function. Samples collected from 32 soft-bottom sites across four habitat types (mangroves, seagrass beds, unvegetated mud bottoms, and coral reefs) yielded 4231 individuals representing 22 higher macrobenthic taxa. The most abundant taxa were polychaetes, nematodes, crustaceans, and mollusks. Mollusk fauna was particularly diverse (105 species and 74 genera) despite being dominated by two taxa: a bivalve (Parvilucina sp.) and gastropods (Caecum spp). Habitat type was weakly interrelated with the faunal composition of the entire macrobenthos and its molluscan component (<20% of explained variance, in both cases). This weak correlation might reflect the influence of within-habitat heterogeneity, ecological drift, or dispersal barriers. Functional traits differed among habitats, with infaunal mollusks typically found in mud bottom and carnivores more abundant in mangroves. The regional mollusk species richness (105 species) exceeded the richness observed within individual gulfs (39, 40, and 59 species), highlighting high regional diversity. Anthropogenic factors could also be at play. The results suggest, tentatively, that fisheries might have affected the functional and taxonomic structuring of the sampled macrobenthic communities. This initial survey suggests that habitat selection does not exert a strong effect on the macrobenthos (or its molluscan component), and other assembly processes such as drift, dispersal, and human impacts may be important.;2018-04;2023-07-04 07:30:56;2024-01-29 12:20:48;;249-268;;2;94;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000439017000007;;;;;;"BIODIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; BIOLOGICAL TRAITS; ASSEMBLAGES; TRACE-METALS; MACROFAUNA; MOLLUSKS; SAMPLING DESIGN; SOFT-BOTTOMS; TAXONOMIC DISTINCTNESS; discu; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NCW9XE8U;journalArticle;2009;"Arkema, KK; Reed, DC; Schroeter, SC";Direct and indirect effects of giant kelp determine benthic community structure and dynamics;ECOLOGY;;0012-9658;10.1890/08-1213.1;;Indirect facilitation can occur when a species positively affects another via the suppression of a shared competitor. In giant kelp forests, shade from the canopy of the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, negatively affects understory algae, which compete with sessile invertebrates for space. This raises the possibility that giant kelp indirectly facilitates sessile invertebrates, via suppression of understory algae. We evaluated the effect of giant kelp on the relative abundance of algae and invertebrates by experimentally manipulating kelp abundance on large artificial reefs located off San Clemente, California, USA. The experiments revealed a negative effect of giant kelp on both light availability and understory algal abundance and a positive effect on the abundance of sessile invertebrates, which was consistent with an indirect effect mediated by shade from the kelp canopy. The importance of these processes to temporal variability in benthic community structure was evaluated at 16 locations on natural reefs off Santa Barbara, California, over an eight-year period. Interannual variability in the abundance of understory algae and in the abundance of sessile invertebrates was significantly and positively related to interannual variability in the abundance of giant kelp. Analysis of these observational data using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) indicated that the magnitude of the indirect effect of giant kelp on invertebrates was six times larger than the direct effect on invertebrates. Results suggest that the dynamics of this system are driven by variability in the abundance of a single structure-forming species that has indirect positive, as well as direct negative, effects on associated species.;2009-11;2023-07-04 07:30:57;2024-04-11 14:18:05;;3126-3137;;11;90;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000271457300016;;;;;;"macroalgae; Macrocystis pyrifera; giant kelp; temporal variability; indirect facilitation; benthic community structure; sea urchin; interannual variability; sessile invertebrate; MACROCYSTIS-PYRIFERA; WAVE EXPOSURE; FOREST; SEA-URCHINS; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; ALGAL COMMUNITY; ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES; ROCKY REEF; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We investigated the relationship between size of Mytilus patches, sediment characteristics and species richness of associated macrofauna, meiofauna and macroalgae on sandy sediments at 7 m depth in the Asko area, northern Baltic proper. A total of 24 associated macrofauna species were identified, 11 of which were not present on bare sediment outside the patches. The bare sediment had on average 5 species, which increased to 6 associated species at a mussel patch size of 5 cm(2) and 17 species at 314 cm 2, which was > 85 % of the associated species in a nearby large mussel bed. The diversity of macro-infauna was higher in mussel patches compared to sediment. Macroalgae, being dependent on mussel shell as substrate or on attachment by byssus threads, were not found outside patches. Sediment contents of total carbon and nitrogen were significantly higher within patches than outside, mainly due to the mussels' filtration and biodeposition of small nutrientrich particles, Diversity of meiofauna did not change with patch size, but total abundance of Nematoda was higher within patches. As patch size increased, the effects of Mytilus on the sediment characteristics became stronger, but few negative effects of increased biodeposition were seen on species richness, The results show that mussel patches represent islands of high biodiversity in sediment areas and belong to the most species-rich habitats in the Baltic Sea, due to structural and functional effects.;2008;2023-07-04 07:30:58;2024-04-12 06:39:24;;75-87;;1;4;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000262027800009;;;;;;"Biodiversity; Community structure; Habitat modification; Engineering species; Associated species; Ecological role; BEDS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; NORTH-SEA; WADDEN SEA; FAUNA; SOFT-BOTTOM; EDULIS L.; HARD-ROCK; Patch size Facilitation; SMALL INTERTIDAL ANIMALS; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As diverse biological assemblages underpin a variety of ecosystem services, understanding broader changes in biodiversity associated with mussel restoration becomes increasingly valuable to scientists and restoration practitioners. Studies generally show bivalve beds increase species richness and abundance, but results are scale-dependent and conditional on the mobility of specific communities observed. We examined biodiversity at multiple scales to determine how communities with varying levels of mobility are influenced by subtidal mussel restoration. Significant changes in assemblage structure were observed in both mobile fish and epifaunal communities, with enhanced species richness and total abundance of associated individuals. In contrast, we observed site-dependent effects of bivalve restoration on macrofaunal community structure and composition, with sheltered, harbour mussel bed communities numerically dominated by detritivores accustomed to organically enriched, muddy sediments. Sediment organic matter significantly increased within mussel beds, and distance-based linear models showed that sediment organic matter was an important predictor of macrofaunal assemblage structure on mussel beds, highlighting the significance of benthic-pelagic coupling and biodeposition to soft-sediment communities. This study contributes novel methods and ecological insights on the role of species mobility and site selection in structuring restoration outcomes, better informing future mussel restoration efforts aimed at emphasising functionally-driven ecosystem services.;2022-03-23;2023-07-04 07:31:00;2024-01-10 10:03:50;;;;1;12;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000772605500040;;;;;;"MARINE BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; SEDIMENT; FISH; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; WADDEN SEA; COMPLEXITY; MYTILUS-EDULIS; BLUE MUSSELS; OYSTER REEF HABITAT; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Sea urchins are common inhabitants of reefs, and their importance for controlling the distribution and abundance of algae in marine ecosystems is well understood. Less understood is the role of habitat complexity and species identity of foundational species in dictating the abundance of reef herbivores. We explored how the structural complexity and identity of 3 corals commonly observed on contemporary Caribbean reefs mediate the abundance, behavior, and demographic characteristics of an increasingly important herbivore, the sea urchin Echinometra viridis. Tethered urchins survived better on the more structurally complex coral Agaricia tenuifolia and hydrocoral Millepora alcicornis than on less complex branching Porites species. However, natural densities of urchins on these corals did not follow the same pattern, suggesting that coral identity, independent of complexity, also contributes to habitat associations. In habitat choice experiments, urchins preferred the structurally complex coral A. tenuifolia only when waterborne cues of predators were introduced. Despite minimal differences in the standing stock of algae associated with the different corals, urchins inhabiting Porites colonies had a marginally higher reproductive condition than those collected from the other corals, suggesting a fitness trade-off to inhabiting the riskier coral. Understanding the drivers of herbivore habitat associations is vital for predicting the persistence of coral-dominated reefs due to feedbacks between changing coral reef communities (both species identity and habitat complexity) and shifts to algal dominance.;2017-08-18;2023-07-04 07:31:00;2024-08-17 09:50:52;;33-47;;;577;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000411307400003;;;;;;"Foundation species; Habitat complexity; Porites; Agaricia tenuifolia; Echinometra viridis; Millepora alcicornis; Predation risk; Gonadosomatic index; SEA-URCHINS; PHASE-SHIFTS; FOOD AVAILABILITY; PATCH REEFS; DIADEMA-ANTILLARUM; BOCAS-DEL-TORO; MACROALGAL COVER; PREDATION RISK; REGION-WIDE DECLINES; URCHIN ECHINOMETRA-VIRIDIS; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We compared assemblage structure of nekton (fish and swimming macroinvertebrates) and epibenthos (macroinvertebrates and macroalgae) between eelgrass bed and below-oyster habitats. We sampled the intertidal zone on Cortes Island at low tide using two methods: quadrats to enumerate epibenthic macroinvertebrates and macroalgae, and beach seines to enumerate fish and swimming macroinvertebrates. Using multivariate analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), we found that the structure of nektonic and epibenthic assemblages associated with below-oyster cobble zones were significantly different from those in eelgrass-beds.

Introduction of non-indigenous macroalgae may have a great impact on associated epifaunal assemblages and ecosystem processes in coastal areas. Previous studies have reported conflicting evidences for the ability of epifauna to colonize non-indigenous species. Here, we analyzed epifaunal assemblages associated with three species of macroalgae that are very abundant on intertidal shores along the Galician coast: the two native species Bifurcaria bifurcata and Saccorhiza polyschides and the invasive species Sargassum muticum. We collected samples of each species from three different sites at three different times to test whether variability of epifaunal assemblages was consistent over space and time.

Here, we examine: i) the polychaete fauna inhabiting aggregations of the ascidian Pyura chilensis in central Chile; ii) the relationship between sample volume (aggregation size) and polychaete assemblage variables; and iii) the effect of a tube-building chaetopterid on the polychaete assemblage structure. The chaetopterid tube load on aggregations determines two ascidian morphotypes, those with a high load of chaetopterid tubes (HT morphotype) and those with a low load of chaetopterid tubes (LT morphotype). From a total of 38 aggregations studied, we found 5,524 specimens belonging to 35 species of polychaetes. Three species were the most abundant in the aggregations (Phyllochaetopterus socialis, Nicolea lobulata, and Typosyllis magdalena), reaching 22% of total abundance. The number of species and individuals increased with sample volume, but only the number of species number varied between morphotypes. Sample volume and the chaetopterid tubes influenced the polychaete assemblage structure, evidencing differences between morphotypes. We suggest that both sample volume and the habitat structuring capacity of the chaetopterid tubes change the habitat complexity of the ascidian aggregations and, hence, produce differences between morphotypes related to the polychaete assemblage structure.";2015-12;2023-07-04 07:31:06;2024-03-25 14:21:42;;733-741;;4;45;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000365873600028;;;;;;"Diversity; Habitat complexity; Ecosystem engineering; Ascidians; Tube-building; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; HABITAT; COAST; EPIFAUNA; ISLANDS; FAUNA; SOFT-BOTTOM; LANICE-CONCHILEGA; CHILENSIS MOLINA; PYURA-STOLONIFERA HELLER; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We tested this notion by investigating the effects of fucoid seaweed canopies on understory communities along rocky intertidal elevation gradients in Atlantic Canada. Such gradients exhibit increasing thermal extremes and variation from low to high elevations, and are broadly used in stress gradient studies. A manipulative experiment created canopy and no-canopy treatments at the low, middle, and high intertidal zones, eliminating all species (except fucoid canopies) from replicate quadrats. After recolonization, overall richness and diversity (considering all primary producers and consumers) were higher under canopies than uncovered by canopies at the high and middle zones, but no effects occurred at the low zone. Similarly, species composition was affected by canopies at the high and middle zones, but not at the low zone. A mensurative study that surveyed the full range of canopy cover (0-100%) using nearly five times more quadrats from pristine areas yielded the same results: richness and diversity increased with canopy cover at the high and middle zones (approaching stabilization toward high cover values), but no effects occurred at the low zone. Lack of canopy effects at low elevations is related to mild habitat conditions, which canopies are unable to modify, while positive effects at higher elevations relate to the capacity of canopies to ameliorate harsh conditions. This is the first time that a combined experimental and mensurative approach shows that the same bioengineer species affect overall species richness, diversity, and composition differently along a stress gradient. Overall, protecting canopy-forming bioengineers to preserve local biodiversity should be most effective in stressful environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The exotic plant Spartina alterniflora has become the most abundant species in the salt marshes of the Yangtze River estuary since it was first found just over a decade ago, but its effects on crabs in the salt marshes is largely unknown. To examine whether the invasions of this exotic plant affected native crabs, we compared the biomass and abundance of the dominant burrowing crab Sesarma dehaani in an exotic Spartina marsh, native Phragmites australis marsh and mudflats of the Yangtze River estuary, China. To explain the differences of S. dehaani populations between different habitats, feeding preference of S. dehaani for Spartina and Phragmites was investigated. Results showed crab abundance and biomass in the Spartina marsh were significantly greater than those in the Phragmites marsh and mudflats. Soil water content and plant community characteristics in the Spartina marsh also significantly differed in the Phragmites marsh and mudflats. moreover, the feeding preference experiment showed that crabs consumed Spartina more than twice as much as Phroymites. In summary, this study showed that Spartina provided compatible habitats for native crab S. dehaani through offering suitable food source and moderate environmental conditions.

Invertebrates were sampled in patches or beds of 4 species of macroalgae (Alaria esculenta, Agarum cribrosum, Desmarestia viridis and Ptilota serrata) as well as in adjacent urchin barrens. Multivariate analyses of the invertebrates on the algal fronds, those on the underlying substratum, and the 2 groups together demonstrated differences in invertebrate assemblages among all 5 habitats. A. esculenta sheltered the most distinct invertebrate community due to the domination of the substratum under this alga by the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. Differences among other canopy types were due to differences in invertebrate assemblages both on the algal fronds and on the substratum. A manipulative experiment involving the removal of the canopy of the 2 most abundant macroalgae, A. esculenta and A. cribrosum, was carried out to examine their effects on mussels. Recruitment of mussels onto ceramic tiles varied among treatments and was greatest in the A. esculenta zone with greater, but non-significant, recruitment under the canopy. The growth of mussels from early July to October was higher in the A. cribrosum zone than the A. esculenta zone. However, there was no effect of the algal canopy in either zone. Our study demonstrates that the local diversity and distribution of benthic invertebrates is intimately associated with macroalgae, and reinforces the need for detailed sampling and analyses for assessing distributional patterns.;2004;2023-07-04 07:31:09;2024-04-15 09:19:10;;121-132;;;271;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000221879800010;;;;;;"ecosystem engineering; biodiversity; positive interactions; community structure; Mytilus edulis; SEA-URCHINS; POSITIVE INTERACTIONS; STRONGYLOCENTROTUS-DROEBACHIENSIS; MARINE-INVERTEBRATES; HABITAT COMPLEXITY; ASTERIAS-VULGARIS; ALGAL SUCCESSION; kelp bed; SEASTARS LEPTASTERIAS-POLARIS; SHORELINE CONFIGURATION; VERTICAL PATTERNS; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, disturbance may damage or move the engineer to a more stressful environment, possibly increasing the importance of facilitation for associated communities. In this study, we determined how disturbance to intertidal boulders (i.e., flipping) and the subsequent movement of a structural ecosystem engineer, the tube-forming serpulid worm Galeolaria caespitosa, from the bottom (natural state, low abiotic stress) to the top (disturbed state, high abiotic stress) surface of boulders influenced the importance of facilitation for intertidal communities across two intertidal zones. Theory predicts stronger relative facilitation should occur in the harsher environments of the top of boulders and the high intertidal zone. To test this prediction, we experimentally positioned boulders with the serpulids either face up or face down for 12 months in low and high zones in an intertidal boulder field. There were very different communities associated with the different boulders and serpulids had the strongest facilitative effects on the more stressful top surface of boulders with approximately double the species richness compared to boulders lacking serpulids. Moreover, within the serpulid matrix itself there was also approximately double the species richness (both zones) and abundance (high zone only) of small invertebrates on the top of boulders compared to the bottom. The high relative facilitation on the top of boulders reflected a large reduction in temperature by the serpulid matrix on that surface (up to 10 degrees C) highlighting a key role for modification of the abiotic environment in determining the community-wide facilitation. This study has demonstrated that disturbance and subsequent movement of an ecosystem engineer to a more stressful environment increased the importance of facilitation and allowed species to persist that would otherwise be unable to survive in that environment.;2017-09;2023-07-04 07:31:10;2024-01-29 12:31:20;;2425-2436;;9;98;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000408836600020;;;;;;"intertidal; facilitation; ecosystem engineering; disturbance; Galeolaria caespitosa; abiotic stress; PATTERNS; HABITAT; ORGANISMS; RECRUITMENT; POSITIVE INTERACTIONS; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; OYSTER REEFS; STRESS; MARINE-INVERTEBRATES; boulder-field; INVASIVE CRAB; serpulid; tube worm; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Intertidal oyster Crassostrea virginica reefs provide a structured habitat for many organisms; however, declining oyster populations have induced reef fragmentation and loss. Over 2 years (2011-2012), we evaluated naturally occurring fringing and patch intertidal oyster reefs in southeastern North Carolina, USA, to determine how varied reef type, size, and distance from edge to interior influenced the associated benthic macrofauna and mobile nekton. In addition, the effects of size and edge vs. interior were examined on constructed intertidal reefs at 2 different locations. On the natural reefs, species richness of benthic macrofauna and mobile nekton were significantly increased on fringing reefs. Benthic macrofauna richness significantly decreased on large natural reefs, whereas mobile nekton richness significantly increased off of large reefs. Further, associated benthic macrofauna richness significantly decreased along the reef edge, whereas mobile nekton diversity increased along the reef/open bottom interface. Species richness and densities for benthic macrofauna increased with created reef size, while there was greater species richness and diversity and dissimilar communities for mobile nekton along constructed reef edges. Habitat specificity may influence utilization for mobile nekton, as resident organisms with limited vagility had a stronger response to habitat characteristics. Thus, utilization of intertidal oyster reefs can be highly structured by habitat characteristics on many scales, and should be considered when examining species interactions, ecosystem management, and future restoration efforts.";2017-10-13;2023-07-04 07:31:11;2024-01-30 08:57:55;;57-70;;;581;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000414582700005;;;;;;"Habitat heterogeneity; Crassostrea virginica; Benthic macrofauna; Oyster reefs; Habitat fragmentation; Habitat restoration; Patch size; Edge effects; RESPONSES; DIVERSITY; CRASSOSTREA-VIRGINICA; FISH; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; SALT-MARSH; FRAGMENTATION; RESTORATION; BLUE CRABS; BOONEA-IMPRESSA; Habitat characteristics; Mobile nekton; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Invasive hybrid cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora x Spartina foliosa) is an ecosystem engineer in salt marshes in San Francisco Bay, California, U.S.A. that raises intertidal elevations and may be either increasing C-4 plant carbon input into food webs or tying up carbon in a form that is not usable by consumers. A manipulative experiment compared abundance, growth, and stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) composition of the clam Macoma petalum (=M. balthica) among native marsh, hybrid Spartina, and mudflats in central San Francisco Bay. We found higher densities (individuals m(-2)) of M. petalum on mudflats compared to either native or hybrid Spartina (p < 0.001). Macoma petalum shell growth was significantly greater in mudflats than in either vegetation type in 2002 (p = 0.005) but not 2003. Differences in shell growth between native and hybrid Spartina were not significant. Stable isotope results showed differences between habitats in delta C-13 but not delta N-15. Carbon signatures of M. petalum placed in Spartina were much more depleted than the isotopic signature of Spartina. Neither native nor hybrid Spartina appears to be a significant carbon source for M. petalum in San Francisco Bay, and we found no evidence that hybrid Spartina contributes carbon to M. petalum beyond what is provided by S. foliosa, despite the hybrid's much greater biomass. Our results show that loss of mudflat habitat, rather than increased input of C-4 carbon, is the greatest effect of the invasion of hybrid Spartina on M. petalum. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, up to now, little or no attention has been paid to the intertidal epi- and hyperbenthic communities associated with the reefs. Therefore, this is the first study which focuses on the effect of L. conchilega reefs on the entire bentho-pelagic community at two different locations. Environmental variables were measured and macro-, epi- and hyperbenthic communities were sampled within a L. conchilega reef and a control area at two locations in France: the bay of the Mont Saint-Michel (BMSM) and Boulogne-sur-Mer (Boulogne). The effect of the reef presence on the benthic community was studied with a 3-factor (Reef, Location and Period) Permanova. In addition, the relationship between the benthic community and the environmental variables was investigated using Distance-based linear models (DistLM). Most collected organisms were sampled in the reef area (macrobenthos: 91%, epi-benthos: 81% and hyperbenthos: 78.5%) indicating that, independent of the location, the L. conchilega reefs positively affect all three associated benthic communities. However, the extent of the effect seems to be most pronounced for the macrobenthos and less distinct in case of the hyperbenthos. The macro-, and epibenthos are mainly structured by biotic variables (L. conchilega density and macrobenthic food availability respectively), while the hyperbenthos is rather structured by environmental variables. In general, L. conchilega reefs do not only affect abundances and diversity but they substantially steer the structure of the intertidal benthic sandy beach ecosystem. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the most widely distributed marine invaders is the kelp Undaria pinnatifida. In Australasia, Undaria is a large annual kelp that typically has a unimodal growth pattern characterized by high cover during late-winter and spring. It is possible that Undaria co-occurs with mussels and impacts the biodiversity of mussel assemblages on rocky reefs, especially given its presence on mussel farms. Here, we tested whether Undaria and mussels co-occurred on rocky reefs at different temporal and spatial scales, and whether Undaria affects the diversity of mussel-associated small mobile invertebrates. Analyses of survey data showed that individuals of Undaria are often attached to, or interspersed around, mussel aggregations in the low intertidal zone where Undaria was found at similar abundances in its typical winter growth and summer senescence seasons. We hypothesize that this unexpected pattern is caused by overlapping generations coupled with longer growing seasons, potentially triggered by localized higher wave action, rather than individual plants persisting for an entire year. Analyses of Undaria holdfasts and non-living mimics of Undaria holdfasts, showed that live and large holdfasts, in particular, alter and increase small-scale diversity of mobile invertebrates where Undaria co-occurs with mussels. We conclude that Undaria has a longer temporal presence where it co-occurs with mussels and that Undaria alter mussel-associated communities of small mobile invertebrates.;2018-10;2023-07-04 07:31:15;2024-01-24 13:20:21;;;;10;165;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000448431500002;;;;;;"SEAWEED; RECRUITMENT; NEW-ZEALAND; FACILITATION CASCADES; LAMINARIALES; RELATIVE IMPORTANCE; HABITAT-FORMATION; CODIUM-FRAGILE; UNDARIA-PINNATIFIDA PHAEOPHYCEAE; WATER MOTION; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I investigated the causes of variable larval recruitment to populations of a temperate reef fish, the kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus). Spatial and temporal variation in the density of settlement habitat on a reef, the giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), explained much of the variation in recruitment of kelp bass. Although recruitment was positively related to Macrocystis density, the relationship was asymptotic at high plant densities, indicating that kelp bass recruitment saturates at intermediate densities of Macrocystis (approximate to 100-130 stipes/ 30 m(2)). Field experiments demonstrated causation between Macrocystis density and kelp bass recruitment and indicated that kelp bass recruitment was linearly related to the local abundance of kelp structure (i.e., the number and biomass of overlapping Macrocystis blades). This linear (nonasymptotic) relationship between Macrocystis blade biomass and density of fish recruits indicated that both the quantity and quality of the recruitment habitat limited larval recruitment. Structural complexity per unit length of plant (e.g., blade biomass per unit plant length) was inversely related to plant density. This relationship underlies the asymptotic relationship between structural complexity per unit reef area (the product of per-plant structural complexity and plant density) and recruit density. Thus, density-dependent constraints on blade biomass in this macroalga, rather than larval supply, better explained the general asymptotic nature of the relationship between Macrocystis and kelp bass recruitment. These results indicate that density-dependent effects on plant biomass and architecture (e.g., plant height and structural complexity), common among both macrophytes and terrestrial plants, can greatly influence the relationship between plant density and recruitment of other species. For organisms with dispersive life stages whose local recruitment is influenced by the occurrence of living habitat structure, spatial and temporal variability characteristic of such biogenic habitats can be a major source of variation in their recruitment.;1994-07;2023-07-04 07:31:16;2024-04-17 06:38:18;;1320-1333;;5;75;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:A1994NV66200012;;;;;;"MORTALITY; HABITAT STRUCTURE; RECRUITMENT; SETTLEMENT; LARVAL SETTLEMENT; MARINE-ALGAE; POPULATION; SPATIAL VARIATION; MACROALGAE; ROCKY INTERTIDAL COMMUNITIES; BIOGENIC HABITAT STRUCTURE; BOTTOM KELP FOREST; FIELD EXPERIMENT; KELP BASS; MACROCYSTIS PYRIFERA; OPEN SYSTEMS; PARALABRAX CLATHRATUS; PLANT ARCHITECTURE; POPULATION DYNAMICS; REEF FISH; SPACE-LIMITED RECRUITMENT; TEMPERATE REEFS; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The pervasive Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, has been shown to affect the diversity and composition of many host ecosystems. We tested for effects of the presence of the invasive C. gigas on native assemblages by comparing them directly to assemblages associated with the declining native European oyster, Ostrea edulis. The presence of both oyster species was manipulated in intertidal and subtidal habitats and reefs were constructed at horizontal and vertical orientation to the substratum. After 12 months, species diversity and benthic assemblage structure between assemblages with C gigas and O. edulis were similar, but differed between habitats and orientation, suggesting that both oyster species were functionally similar in terms of biodiversity facilitation. These findings support evidence, that non-native species could play an important role in maintaining biodiversity in systems with declining populations of native species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The physical component is the spatial environment created by the ecosystem engineer, while the biological component is the physiological activity of the engineering species. However, little is known about the ratio between these components. We evaluated this ratio for Mytilus edulis L. by means of a field experiment in which communities of organisms that developed on bare ceramic plates (controls, C) were compared with those that formed on plates carrying patches of live mussels (L) or artificial patches made of mussel dummies (D). The experiment was performed using 2 different age-size groups of mussels and dummies (small-young and large-old). Live mussels had only a weak positive effect on species richness of the associated organisms, but the structure of the communities that formed on tests plates (L, D and C) differed significantly. The similarity of the communities of associated organisms between C and L was 1.5-3 times less than between C and D. Mussel size-age factor had no significant effect on community structure other than on the algal assemblage. The results of this experiment suggest that the influence of mussels on associated organisms cannot be reduced to only the effect of increasing complexity of the spatial environment. The influence of the biological component is significant and can exceed that of the physical component. Thus, in ecosystem engineering, non-living spatial structures cannot serve as an identical substitute for a population of living organisms.;2021-09-16;2023-07-04 07:31:19;2024-01-17 08:27:10;;15-35;;;674;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000705289500002;;;;;;"Ecosystem engineer; Fouling community; White Sea; HABITAT; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; MUSSEL BEDS; FAUNA; SPECIES COMPOSITION; SMALL INTERTIDAL ANIMALS; WHITE SEA; LIMNOPERNA-FORTUNEI; SESSILE INVERTEBRATES; FOULING COMMUNITIES; Negative impacts; Positive impacts; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, most studies have oversimplified actual connections between fish assemblages and their habitats by using univariate correlations. The purpose of this study was to identify the features of habitat forming corals that facilitate and influences assemblages of associated species such as fishes. For this we developed three-dimensional models of colonies of Acropora cervicornis to estimate geometry (length and height), structural complexity (i.e., volume, density of branches, etc.) and biological features of the colonies (i.e., live coral tissue, algae). We then correlated these colony characteristics with the associated fish assemblage using multivariate analyses. We found that geometry and complexity were better predictors of the structure of fish community, compared to other variables such as percentage of live coral tissue or algae. Combined, the geometry of each colony explained 40% of the variability of the fish assemblage structure associated with this coral species; 61% of the abundance and 69% of fish richness, respectively. Our study shows that three-dimensional reconstructions of discrete colonies of Acropora cervicornis provides a useful description of the colonial structural complexity and may explain a great deal of the variance in the structure of the associated coral reef fish community.

The sun corals Tubastraea coccinea and T. tagusensis have successfully invaded reef habitats along the Brazilian coast, drastically reducing the diversity of benthic fouling invertebrates and macroalgae at places where colonies had taken large fractions of the available space. Yet, there is no consistent information on the effects of this invasion on assemblages of mobile invertebrates. We sampled shallow vertical reef areas at Buzios Island, SP, Brazil, and compared univariate and multivariate attributes of these assemblages at different levels of sun-coral cover (no cover, half and full cover), at two sites separated by a few km, and two areas within sites separated by several tens of meters. Consistent declines of overall abundance and biomass with increasing coral cover were found at one sampled site, while richness responded only to small-scale heterogeneity with no sun-coral effects. Changes in assemblage structure were area-specific, but similarity analyses most often grouped no coral and half coral cover, leaving aside full coral plots. Tanaids, ostracods and harpacticoid copepods were among the most important groups where sun corals were absent or covering only half of the reef habitat. However, these groups became almost absent in coral saturated habitats. Polychaetes also contributed substantially to dissimilarities, but effects on this group were less clear. Overall, results suggest a negative tipping point between partial to nearly full coral cover, especially at sites where physically complex macroalgae, capable to retain sediments and hence the invertebrates therein, are displaced by the establishment and growth of sun-coral colonies. As important prey for reef fishes, the collapse of small crustacean populations may alter whole-reef ecosystem functioning and negatively impact local fisheries.;2019-04;2023-07-04 07:31:23;2024-01-22 15:09:57;;1339-1350;;4;21;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000463042000022;;;;;;"Habitat complexity; Alternative stable states; Ecosystem engineer; Exotic species; Space monopolization; PATTERNS; BIOGEOGRAPHY; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; DYNAMICS; MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS; FISH COMMUNITY; SELECTION; COPEPODA; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A total of 24,140 epifaunal individuals were counted from 30 holdfasts of each kelp species. Overall epifaunal abundances exceeded faunal abundances previously reported from holdfasts of other kelps. Three taxonomic groups, Amphipoda, Mollusca, and Polychaeta, accounted for ca. 85% of all individuals. Total abundances increased with the amount of habitat available, quantified either as the volume or the area provided by the holdfasts. The multivariate structure of the epifaunal assemblage did not differ between holdfasts of the two kelp species. However, epifaunal assemblages responded differentially to the habitat attributes provided by each type of kelp holdfast: multivariate variation in the assemblage structure of epifauna was mostly explained by holdfast area and volume for L. hyperborea, and by the surface-to-volume ratio for S. polyschides holdfasts. Therefore, the physical attributes of biogenic habitats, here kelp holdfasts that better predict patterns in the assemblage structure of associated fauna can differ according to their different physical morphology, even though the overall assemblage structure of associated fauna was similar.;2011-01;2023-07-04 07:31:25;2024-04-11 07:13:38;;373-382;;1;658;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000284598200031;;;;;;"Habitat complexity; Epifauna; Saccorhiza polyschides; Laminaria hyperborea; Assemblage structure; Kelp holdfast; COMMUNITIES; LAMINARIA-HYPERBOREA; MACROCYSTIS-PYRIFERA; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; SEA; FAUNA; MACROFAUNA; HABITAT COMPLEXITY; TAXONOMIC RESOLUTION; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Two different mechanisms may influence the distribution and abundance patterns of these associated organisms: those generated by the biological properties of cordgrasses and those caused or mediated by the physical structure supplied by the plants. The aims of this study were: (1) to determine the effect of cordgrasses on macroinvertebrate assemblages dominating a rocky marsh and (2) to determine how much of this effect is caused by the physical structure supply by the plants. In order to achieve these objectives, we conducted two field manipulative experiments. In the first one, we manipulated the presence of defaunated transplants of cordgrass, and in the second one, we did the same with plastic cordgrass mimics simulating the architecture of Spartina densiflora. In both experiments, sessile and mobile assemblages were separately examined to evaluate whether they respond in the same way or not. Abundance and richness of mobile and sessile organisms were higher in transplant and mimic cordgrass plots compared to the controls, indicating that the presence of cordgrasses, either transplanted or artificial, has a positive effect on sessile and mobile assemblages. Furthermore, we found that the composition of mobile and sessile macroinvertebrates assemblages did not differ between transplants and mimics. Therefore, the physical structure of cordgrass was found to be the major factor influencing macroinvertebrates assemblages in the studied Patagonia rocky salt marshes. Within the period of 1 year, mobile and sessile fauna colonized several times more abundantly transplant and artificial cordgrass than the control unvegetated plots, highlighting the key role of cordgrasses in optimizing the colonization rate of macroinvertebrate communities in this rocky bottom environment. Since Spartina densiflora is invading different regions worldwide, our study may help to predict its potential effect on the invaded communities.;2012-03;2023-07-04 07:31:25;2024-03-25 16:04:46;;25-36;;1;46;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000299842700003;;;;;;"Patagonia; Macroinvertebrates; Colonization; Habitat-forming species; Artificial structures; SEAGRASS BEDS; INVERTEBRATES; FLOW; PREDATION; MUSSELS; RELATIVE IMPORTANCE; ALTERNIFLORA; FOOD; ARTIFICIAL SEAGRASS; HABITAT CHOICE; done; to do";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Macroscopic thalli of C. fragile are not perennial, but develop from propagules and/or undifferentiated forms in early spring, when the dominant native space-occupier, the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, recruits. By mid-summer, rapid growth of C. fragile leads to the formation of a dense canopy. We investigated the effects of juvenile and adult thalli of C. fragile on recruitment, survival and growth of mussels. Two experiments tested the hypotheses: (1) that recruitment of mussels is greater within patches of juvenile thalli (primordia) of C. fragile than on adjacent bare surfaces; (2) that the presence of a canopy of C. fragile affects the survival and growth of mussel recruits. The number of recruits of mussels was significantly larger within clumps of primordia of C. fragile than on bare surfaces. The removal of the canopy of C. fragile affected negatively the density of mussels after 2 months from the start of the experiment, but there were no effects on the mean size of individuals, nor on the size-frequency distribution. The same trend persisted after 4 months from the start of the experiment. These results show that re-colonisation of space by mussels is enhanced by C. fragile. Given that mussels, in turn, have the potential to reduce recruitment rates of C. fragile, quick recovery of mussel beds after disturbances could be crucial for controlling the abundance of this alga on breakwaters. Results also suggest that the effects of introduced species on native assemblages can be explained only through studies encompassing different life-stages of interacting organisms.";2006-04;2023-07-04 07:31:26;2024-04-15 08:06:13;;1213-1220;;6;148;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000236382800003;;;;;;"MARINE; GROWTH; SETTLEMENT; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; COMMUNITY; ASSEMBLAGES; CANOPY ALGAE; SARGASSUM-MUTICUM; KELP UNDARIA-PINNATIFIDA; EXPOSED ROCKY SHORE; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, most studies testing effects of disturbance on community structure use treatments where the dominant species is either present or absent, and usually record responses of only a few community components. Here, we test responses of the entire local community of benthic algae and invertebrates across a gradient of disturbance to a habitat dominant in southern New Zealand, the fucoid alga Hormosira banksii. Replicate 0.25 m(2) plots of 100 % cover of H. banksii were manipulated and maintained at 0, 25, 50 and 75 % cover at 2 sites for 13 mo. Throughout the experiment, communities in the complete removal and control plots were the most different from each other, but intermediate plots had varied responses and were usually not significantly different from each other. Generally, as cover of H. banksii decreased, community variability increased through time. Taxa richness declined with reduced H. banksii cover, with up to 77 % of its variation explained by variation in canopy cover. Other fucoid algae declined across the gradient, with complete canopy removals having 92 % less fucoid cover than control plots. Complete canopy removal had positive effects on ephemeral algae, especially at one site which exhibited large seasonal blooms. Bare space was greatest where canopies were completely removed and understory algae died. Diversity was greatest in plots with complete canopies rather than at intermediate levels, and there was no replacement of the dominant H. banksii by other species. There was no consistent effect on taxa across the gradient; some species responded linearly while others responded at threshold levels of canopy cover. This study shows the importance of disturbance gradients interacting with key species, which may have considerable bearing on reef community structure.";2007;2023-07-04 07:31:29;2024-04-15 07:35:25;;1-11;;;339;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000247713900001;;;;;;"disturbance; canopy; Hormosira banksii; positive interaction; threshold; PATTERNS; RESPONSES; DIVERSITY; RECOVERY; ASSEMBLAGE; SUCCESSION; REMOVAL; ROCKY; PHYSICAL DISTURBANCES; MAINTENANCE; gradient; habitat-forming algae; species removal; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this study we determined the effects of the native tube-forming serpulid worm, Galeolaria caespitose on the recruitment of the invasive New Zealand porcelain crab, Petrolisthes elongatus, and whether invasive crab recruitment was related to the recruitment of native species. P. elongatus is abundant beneath intertidal rocks around Tasmania, southern Australia, and the underside of these rocks is usually covered with a calcareous matrix formed by the serpulid. We used an experimental approach to investigate whether rocks, serpulids on the underside of rocks and adult P. elongatus influenced the recruitment P. elongatus and native communities. P. elongatus and native invertebrates only recruited in the presence of rocks indicating the importance of rock as primary recruitment habitat. Moreover, the presence of serpulids on the underside of rocks significantly increased the recruitment of P. elongatus and native invertebrates compared to rocks without serpulids. Rocks with higher densities of adult P. elongatus at the end of the experiment also had higher densities of P. elongatus recruits. The density of P. elongatus recruits did not influence native species richness and abundance although there was some evidence that high P. elongatus recruitment was correlated with shifts in native community structure. We have shown that a native ecosystem engineer facilitates recruitment of an invasive crab but this does not appear to influence the recruitment of native species.;2016-11;2023-07-04 07:31:29;2024-03-25 09:22:53;;3163-3173;;11;18;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000385159900010;;;;;;"Community structure; Facilitation; Recruitment; Petrolisthes elongatus; Australia; Galeolaria caespitose; Invasive crab; Marine intertidal; Serpulid; COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; ORGANISMS; COMPLEXITY; INTERACTION WEBS; POPULATION; BIOTIC RESISTANCE; SHORE CRAB; HEMIGRAPSUS; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study investigates key ecological functions performed by an engineer species that colonizes coastal ecosystems. The gregarious tubiculous amphipod Haploops nirae is used as a biological model. According to previous studies, the habitat engineered by H.nirae (i.e., Haploops habitat) could provide food and natural shelter for several benthic species such as benthic diatoms belonging to the gender Navicula, the micrograzer Geitodoris planata, or the bivalve Polititapes virgineus. Using data from scientific surveys conducted in two bays, this study explored whether (1) the Haploops sandy-mud community modifies invertebrate and ichthyologic community structure (diversity and biomass); (2) H.nirae creates a preferential feeding ground; and (3) this habitat serves as a refuge for juvenile fish. Available Benthic Energy Coefficients, coupled with more traditional diversity indices, indicated higher energy available in Haploops habitat than in two nearby habitats (i.e., Sternaspis scutata and Amphiura filiformis/Owenia fusiformis habitats). The use of isotopic functional indices (IFIs) indicated (1) a higher functional richness in the Haploops habitat, related to greater diversity in food sources and longer food chains; and (2) a higher functional divergence, associated with greater consumption of a secondary food source. At the invertebrate-prey level, IFIs indicated little specialization and little trophic redundancy in the engineered habitat, as expected for homogenous habitats. Our results partly support empirical knowledge about engineered versus nonengineered habitats and also add new perspectives on habitat use by fish and invertebrate species. Our analyses validated the refuge-area hypothesis for a few fish species. Although unique benthic prey assemblages are associated with Haploops habitat, the hypothesis that it is a preferential feeding area was not verified. However, specialist feeding behavior was observed for predators, which calls for further investigation.";2017-08;2023-07-04 07:31:30;2024-07-16 14:20:47;;5542-5559;;15;7;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000407485300001;;;;;;"stable isotopes; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; COD GADUS-MORHUA; FEEDING ECOLOGY; STABLE ISOTOPES; coastal nurseries; CONCARNEAU SOUTH BRITTANY; fish community; Haploops nirae; isotopic diversity indices; LENGTH-WEIGHT RELATIONSHIPS; NIRAE KAIM-MALKA; POOR-COD; TRISOPTERUS-MINUTUS L; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There are no detailed published accounts of algae and animals growing on seagrasses in South Africa. The seagrass Thalassodendron leptocaule (previously known as Thalassodendron ciliatum) is unique among southern African seagrasses in that it occurs on exposed rocky outcrops along the Mozambican and north-eastern South African coasts; most other seagrasses are restricted to sheltered bays and estuaries. Here we present accounts of species of flora and fauna identified growing epiphytically on this seagrass in northern KwaZulu-Natal. A total of 52 taxa of macroalgae and 204 species of macroinvertebrates were identified as epiphytic on South African T. leptocaule. The most frequently observed macroalgal epiphytes were predominantly Rhodophyta and were common among periodically exposed, intertidal and subtidal habitats. The crustose red coralline algae Pneophyllum amplexifrons and Hydrolithon farinosum were frequently observed, primarily on stems and leaves of the seagrass respectively. The most diverse groups of epiphytic invertebrates were Arthropoda, Annelida and Mollusca, which together comprised 76% of the macroinvertebrate species recorded.

Non-random species turnover occurs in places where environmental filtering plays the key role in determining local community structure, whereas dispersal limitation causes nested patterns of species assemblages organized by non-random colonization processes. However, factors that modify the relative importance of these processes remain unclear for many ecosystems. We tested whether salinity gradient affect the relative importance of environmental filtering and dispersal limitation for structuring epifaunal and infaunal communities in three lagoons in Hokkaido, Japan, that have different salinity gradients. Specifically, we compared patterns of species diversity and similarity of eelgrass-associated invertebrate assemblages across space. Beta diversity (i.e., species turnover among different sites in each lagoon) was highest in Akkeshi, the lagoon with the salinity gradients. Variation partitioning of similarity components showed that spatial variation in the community assemblage pattern was mostly explained by environmental filtering in Akkeshi, but that it was explained more by species dispersal patterns and the difference in eelgrass biomass and shoot density in Notoro and Saroma, the lagoons without clear salinity gradient. Redundancy analysis showed that spatial variation in community structure was related to salinity and eelgrass biomass in Akkeshi, and to eelgrass aboveground biomass in Notoro and Saroma. Our findings highlight the effects of environmental heterogeneity on beta diversity and community structure and indicate that environmental gradients can be a key factor causing a shift in the relative importance of different metacommunity processes and the role of the foundation species in provisioning habitat.;2020-01;2023-07-04 07:31:31;2024-04-17 14:23:13;;61-75;;1;35;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000508848900007;;;;;;"metacommunity; environmental filtering; salinity gradient; SEAGRASS BEDS; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; COEXISTENCE; BETA-DIVERSITY; SPATIAL VARIATION; DISPERSAL; INTERTIDAL SEAGRASS; SALINITY GRADIENT; BENTHIC MACROFAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES; eastern Hokkaido; epifauna and infauna; METACOMMUNITIES; done; to do";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Subsequent global warming most likely facilitated the establishment of wild populations throughout the French coastline. This phenomenon of spread has become so great that oyster reefs have recently appeared in sheltered estuaries, on both soft and hard substrate. The present study examined two such sites in the Bay of Brest, Brittany. It is the first to investigate the impacts of this new substrate on the biocoenosis of uncolonised intertidal habitats in France. Increased species richness and abundance of intertidal macrofauna were observed in the presence of oyster reefs on both, mud (4 and 20 fold respectively) and rock (5 fold for both). The dominance of suspension feeders in mud changed to carnivores in reefs and their underlying sediment. Calculation of biotic coefficients (BC) of the soft-bottom fauna revealed only a slight organic enrichment, and the organic and silt composition in the sediment beneath oyster reefs were not significantly different from that on bare sites. On rock, the dominance of grazers remained unchanged between bare rock and oyster reef, while reef on rock was also characterised by deposit and detritic feeders. C. gigas is suspected to cause a homogenisation of coastal habitats with an impoverishment of overall quality but we detected only 11 common species between reefs on mud (60 species) and those on rock (55 species).

Nonetheless, sublittoral mussel beds on rocky shores have rarely been examined in a patch context to determine the processes creating and maintaining the diversity and assemblages of organisms occupying them. Whereas the species-area relationship is a well-established theory in ecology, less is known about its effect on faunal compositions in aquatic habitats. Also, the effect of patch shape and relative patch edge are poorly studied within a rocky shore mussel framework. The present study examined the effects of blue mussel patch size, patch shape, and the presence of algae and sand in mussel patches on the composition and diversity of associated macrofaunal communities in sublittoral habitats. In line with the species-area relationship, we found that the total number of taxa increased with patch size up to ca. 500 cm(2), thereafter declining. Small patches largely lacked annelid worms and showed a lower diversity of gastropod species. We also found that the diversity was further enhanced by a high biomass of blue mussels, the presence of algae and the weight of interstitial sand. The shape of the patch had no effect on species richness, but affected the species composition. We conclude that structural components of sublittoral blue mussel habitats, such as patch content and shape, greatly affect the diversity and faunal assemblage. This has important implications in conservation biology, since habitats are becoming more fragmented. Our study demonstrates that not only habitat quantity, but also quality has a large impact on species communities in marine ecosystems.;2011;2023-07-04 07:31:33;2024-04-11 08:01:52;;261-270;;3;12;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000291696100007;;;;;;"Ecosystem engineer; Macrofauna; Baltic Sea; Rocky shores; Edge effect; DIVERSITY; BEDS; SIZE; MYTILUS-EDULIS; FAUNA; AREA; HABITAT COMPLEXITY; SMALL INTERTIDAL ANIMALS; SEAGRASS LANDSCAPES; MICROHABITAT SELECTION; Patch shape; Species-area relationship; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Here, we assessed whether the bulbous holdfast of S. polyschides could replace the intricate holdfast of L. ochroleuca as epifaunal habitat provider. Richness, diversity and total abundance of epifauna was similar in both seaweeds, while colonial/encrusting fauna was more abundant in L. ochroleuca. More importantly, each host supported a distinctive assemblage structure, indicating that S. polyschides seems an unsuitable replacement for L. ochroleuca as habitat provider for holdfast epifauna.

Their loss may impact reef ecosystems in different ways, including the collapse of small canopy-dwelling invertebrates, and thus the decline of juvenile reef fish that prey on them. To evaluate this potential loss, we assessed (1) the differences between the mobile invertebrate assemblages associated with turf-forming (filamentous and articulated coralline turf) and canopy-forming (Sargassum spp. and Dichotomaria marginata) algae, and (2) the mechanisms underlying those contrasts by examining the invertebrate community assembly of filamentous turf and Sargassum spp. over the main canopy season. Abundance, biomass and diversity almost always differed between canopies and turfs (although not in a consistent way across sampling sites), while differences within canopy and turf algal types were nearly absent. The structure of invertebrate assemblages differed more consistently between canopies and turfs, with certain hard-bodied and soft-bodied invertebrates characterizing canopies and turfs, respectively. This divergence increased as the canopy season advanced. While no temporal changes occurred in turf invertebrate assemblages, clear temporal dynamics occurred in the invertebrate fauna associated with Sargassum. Brittle stars and amphipods were most abundant as early colonizers, followed by hard-shelled gastropods, bivalves and ostracods. By the end of the season, these groups became dominant and decreased diversity in the canopy habitat. As hard-shelled prey are preferred items for the main invertivore fish species in the area, results suggest that canopies may play an important role in the provisioning of trophic resources to pelagic consumers.;2020-08-13;2023-07-04 07:31:35;2024-07-16 08:22:15;;79-92;;;647;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000621231500006;;;;;;"Ecosystem engineering; Competition; Reef fish; Ecological succession; Phase-shifts; FISH ASSEMBLAGES; REEF FISHES; COMMUNITY; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; SEASONAL-VARIATION; ROCKY SHORE; 1820 PHAEOPHYTA; CYMOSUM C.-AGARDH; MIRABILIS ECHINODERMATA OPHIUROIDEA; PONTA-DAS-GAROUPAS; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Nonindigenous macroalgae may induce changes in composition and structure of epifaunal assemblages and therefore support different assemblages from those associated with native species. In this study, differences in faunal community structure between the introduced fucoid Sargassum muticum and the native seagrass Cymodocea nodosa were tested over a year on an intertidal shallow sandy bottom at the southern introduction front, the ElJadida coastline (NW Morocco). Epifaunal community structure consistently differed between macrophytes through seasons, with more species-rich assemblages associated with S.muticum than C.nodosa despite comparable abundances. The significantly greater epifauna diversity on S.muticum may be related to its structural complexity. However, the species contributing most to differences in assemblages between both macrophytes, such as Steromphala umbilicalis and S.pennanti, were found on both habitats with temporally varying abundances. Some species-specific affinities were detected (Stenosoma cf. acuminatum, Elasmopus vachoni, Chauvetia brunnea). Nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, suspended matter and temperature were identified as the best explanatory variables contributing to the observed macroepifaunal patterns. This study provides evidence that S.muticum acts as a favourable and additional habitat for epifaunal species and supports a more diverse epifaunal assemblage in this Moroccan seagrass meadow.;2018-06;2023-07-04 07:31:37;2024-01-29 12:19:30;;;;3;39;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000443232500003;;;;;;"epifauna; Sargassum muticum; assemblage structure; Cymodocea nodosa; Morocco; MARINE MACROALGAE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; CYMODOCEA-NODOSA; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; MOBILE EPIFAUNA; Atlantic coast; EASTERN ATLANTIC; INVASIVE MACROALGAE; LITTORAL SEAWEED EPIFAUNA; ST-CROIX-ISLAND; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

On temperate rocky reefs, the presence and characteristics of canopy-forming kelps and the architectural complexity, or rugosity, of the underlying rocky substratum are foundational elements of habitat complexity. However, it is not yet clear how these factors shape the size structure of rocky-reef-associated fish communities. Here, we use biomass spectrum models to evaluate how fish community size structure in high-latitude rocky-reef kelp forests is shaped by substratum rugosity and the degree of closure and density of the kelp canopy. We found that the presence of a closed kelp canopy was associated with an average 75% increase in overall fish biomass compared to open-canopy reefs. Furthermore, on the highest-rugosity reefs, the biomass of small fishes (32-64 g) was 800% higher than on the lowest-rugosity reefs, while large fish (1-2 kg) biomass was 60% lower. Consequently, biomass was more evenly distributed across body-size classes on high-rugosity reefs. By decomposing the biomass spectrum into total biomass and mean individual body mass, we found that higher kelp stipe densities also tended to be associated with larger fishes, but this effect was outweighed by the tendency for more small-bodied fishes with increasing rugosity. This study demonstrates how size-based analyses can give new insights into the ecology of temperate reef communities, and may be useful for tracking changes in kelp-associated assemblages in the coming decades with the maturation of marine protected areas, the recovery of sea otter populations, and changing climate.;2015-07-21;2023-07-04 07:31:40;2024-07-12 12:17:01;;197-211;;;532;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000358445600016;;;;;;"Community ecology; Foundation species; Biomass size spectra; Coral reef; Ecosystem baseline; Energy flow; DIVERSITY; ECOLOGY; NEW-ZEALAND; INDICATORS; SEA OTTERS; ASSEMBLAGES; KELP FOREST; BODY-SIZE; DISTRIBUTIONS; SPECTRA; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As these tropical trees expand poleward, they are replacing herbaceous saltmarsh vegetation. Mangroves and saltmarsh vegetation are ecosystem engineers that are typically viewed as having similar ecosystem functions. However, few studies have investigated whether predation regimes, community structure, and ecosystem functions are shifting at the saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone. In this study, we manipulated predator access to marsh and mangrove creekside habitats to test their role in mediating vegetation and invertebrate structure and stability in a two-year experiment. We also conducted a survey to evaluate how shifting vegetation is modifying structural complexity, invertebrate communities, and ecosystem functioning at the ecotone. Excluding larger (> 2 cm diameter) predators did not affect vegetation or invertebrate structure or stability in either saltmarsh or mangrove habitats. The survey revealed that the two habitat types consistently differ in structural metrics, including vegetation height, inter-stem distance, and density, yet they support similar invertebrate and algal communities, soil properties, and predation rates. We conclude that although mangrove range expansion immediately modifies habitat structural properties, it is not altering larger predator consumptive effects, community stability, community composition, or some other ecosystem functions and properties at the ecotone.;2019-11;2023-07-04 07:31:42;2024-01-22 10:45:43;;;;11;11;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000500005400003;;;;;;"habitat complexity; Spartina alterniflora; predation; climate change; Avicennia germinans; ecotone; STABILITY; FISHES; BIODIVERSITY; HABITAT; SPECIES RICHNESS; INVERTEBRATES; EXPANSION; HETEROGENEITY; FOOD; ATLANTIC COAST; intertidal vegetation; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Kelp species are distributed along similar to 25% of the world's coastlines, where they serve as foundation species in intertidal and subtidal habitats. As well as ameliorating environmental conditions and producing organic matter, they provide biogenic habitat for a vast array of associated organisms. Here, we investigated patterns of diversity and structure in assemblages associated with the stipe of the kelp Laminaria hyperborea in the NE Atlantic. Stipes were sampled at 4 study regions (with 3 sites nested within each region) in the UK, spanning similar to 9 degrees of latitude. Stipe-associated communities were highly diverse (134 species) and abundant (16-4532 ind. stipe(-1)), with no obvious sequential shift in diversity or overall trends in abundance/biomass of assemblages with latitude. However, we observed high degrees of variability between sites from the same region and individuals within sites, indicating that processes working across smaller spatial scales were more important than those at regional scales. While we observed high between-site variability in assemblage structure, regional differences were also evident. Most notably, sites within our southernmost region (southern England) were largely devoid of amphipods that dominated all other regions. This study highlights the important role of L. hyperborea in elevating biodiversity at local to regional scales through a facilitative interaction. Moreover, given that L. hyperborea forests may be increasingly impacted by ocean warming, changes in coastal water quality and proposed exploitation, our study serves as an important benchmark against which to detect future changes.;2021-08-19;2023-07-04 07:31:44;2024-01-15 12:28:17;;33-44;;;672;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000691315800003;;;;;;"Ecosystem engineer; Biogenic habitat; Secondary production; Facilitation cascade; Trophic cascade; DIVERSITY; CLIMATE; SEA-URCHINS; ABUNDANCE; CONSEQUENCES; REEF FISHES; HABITAT; FACILITATION; MACROFAUNA; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In New Zealand, green-lipped mussels, Perna canaliculus, commonly dominate wave-exposed rocky shores. The recent appearance of an invasive ecosystem engineer, the ascidian Pyura doppelgangera, at the very northern tip of New Zealand now threatens to exclude these bivalves from this habitat. Here, we report major shifts in assemblages associated with the invader and chronicle its continued spread. We examined epibiota associated with clumps of mussels and clumps of Pyura from two rocky shore habitatspools and emergent substrata at two locations. We detected some differences in species richness in biota associated with the two foundation species, but faunal abundance only differed between the locations. These minor changes were dwarfed by the shift in species composition within clumps of each foundation species. Molluscs, particularly gastropods, and crustaceans dominated the assemblage within mussels. In contrast, tubicolous polychaetes dominated the fauna associated with the ascidian. Sessile epifauna, notably barnacles and calcareous tube-dwelling polychaetes, were common on mussels, but never encountered on the ascidian. Multivariate analysis revealed marked dissimilarity (>80%) between the characteristic mussel and ascidian faunas with virtually no overlap. This biotic shift overshadowed any differences between habitats and locations. The broader implications of these faunal shifts for local and regional patterns of biodiversity, as well as ecosystem function, remain unclear, but deserve further attention.;2018-06;2023-07-04 07:31:45;2024-01-29 10:43:44;;;;3;39;;;;;;;;;;English;;;;WOS:000443232500006;;;;;;"rocky reefs; invasion biology; Pyura; sea squirt; HABITAT; ORGANISMS; COMMUNITY; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; MUSSEL; MARINE ECOSYSTEM; TUNICATA; PYURA-STOLONIFERA HELLER; PRAEPUTIALIS; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this study, we provide the first ecological characterization of the southern-most population of C. gigas; where the composition, density, richness and diversity of the macroinvertebrate assemblages associated with zones with oysters were compared with zones where it is absent at four different times of the year. Additionally, the main epibionts taxa settled on the oyster shells were studied. Our results showed differences in the assemblage composition between zones. However, these differences were not consistent throughout the year. Furthermore, density, richness and diversity were higher in the zones with oysters only in one of the surveys and the parameters did not differ between zones in the remaining months. Moreover, the majority of oysters were used as settlement substrate by the sessile common species present in the area.

In this sense, an increase in populations of the zoanthids Palythoa canariensis and Zoanthus sp. is expected for the Canary Islands being able to change local habitats and biodiversity. Within this study the potential of these species to modify the composition of their associated fauna in intertidal pools of the Canaries was assessed. The composition and biodiversity of communities in intertidal habitats dominated by P. canariensis and Zoanthus sp. were compared with habitats dominated by macroalgae. Samples were collected in order to quantify the mesofauna, and coverage of algae and zoanthids colonies were assessed. Results showed significant differences in the composition of the associated fauna between both kind of habitats, as well as an increase in species diversity and richness in habitats dominated by colonies of both zoanthids. The high potential of P. canariensis and especially of Zoanthus sp. to transform the habitat and associated communities of invertebrates in intertidal environments of the Canary Islands was demonstrated. Given the expected climate change scenario for the future that will benefit the expansion of these key zoanthids, important changes in the biodiversity and potential alterations in natural ecosystems are expected for the Archipelago.

Overall, the 3D fractal analysis method used here better describes seaweeds structural complexity compared to the traditional 2D fractal analysis, as highlighted by the higher relationship with gastropod assemblage associated to the alga in terms of abundance, number of species and morpho-functional groups.

As habitat formers, soft corals constitute a morphologically diverse component of coral reefs, although their importance as fish habitat is largely unquantified. Our study assessed relationships between soft and hard coral habitats and assemblages of reef-associated fishes on inshore reefs of the Whitsunday Islands, focussing on pomacentrids, chaetodontids and pomacanthids. Study sites varied in hard and soft coral cover and were assessed by the level of exposure to previous cyclone damage. The soft coral community was dominated by Sinularia spp. and constituted an average of 11.4% of benthic cover compared to 16% hard coral cover. At fine spatial scales (250 m2), significant positive relationships between soft coral cover and abundance occurred for 2 species of pomacentrids (Amblyglyphidodon curacao and A. leucogaster) as well as total Chaetodontidae and Pomacanthidae. Further, it was clear that some taxa were associated with specific soft corals. For example, A. curacao, Pomacentrus lepidogenys and Chelmon rostratus were observed associating with branching digitate Sinularia, which has a structurally complex morphology. The combination of high and medium cover of hard and soft corals supported distinct assemblages of fishes and the highest abundances of many species at the scale of sites (1000 m2). Our results indicate that soft corals provide valuable habitat, supporting diverse fish assemblages by contributing to habitat mosaics on coral reefs. These findings suggest that the ecological role of soft corals has been underestimated and therefore holds direct implications for the management of coral reefs. © Inter-Research 2022.;2022;2023-07-04 07:31:53;2024-01-10 13:41:05;;15-28;;;698;;Mar.

However, seagrass habitats are being degraded globally due to modification of coastline, terrestrial inputs, and climate change. While the effects of seagrass meadows vegetation density on associated macrofauna standing stocks and taxonomic richness have been widely investigated, the relationships with functional diversity aspects remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate if macrofauna standing stocks and richness indicators (both taxonomic and functional) are related to the habitat-builders presence and structural characteristics (density, biomass, diversity) in temperate Zostera marina Linnaeus, 1753 meadows (Baltic Sea). Relationships between faunal (density, biomass, species and functional trait composition and diversity), vegetation and sediment indicators were tested based on materials collected by scuba divers. Macrofauna density (ranging from 587.6 ± 188.2 to 4514.1 ± 977.8 ind. 0.1 m−2), biomass (ranging from 43.1 ± 28.3 to 13.6 ± 30.8 g 0.1 m−2) and species richness (ranging from 7 ± 1.4 to 20 ± 1.4) responded positively to seagrass presence regardless of meadows characteristics. Functional trait richness ranged from 203.7 ± 64.3 to 44.7 ± 41.1 and was enhanced only in presence of the greatest macrophyte diversity. Therefore, it is the diversity of meadows that boosts the functional richness of associated fauna. This implies that 1) monospecies seagrass meadows do not necessarily provide a higher number of functions than neighboring bare sediments in systems with low diversity such as Baltic Sea, 2) both taxonomic and functional indicators should be used to describe macrofauna communities. This result is an important message for conservation planning for systems with low diversity, as restoration of at least a few macrophytes species not only the dominant seagrass species could be considered to secure greater taxonomic and functional richness. © 2022 The Authors;2022;2023-07-04 07:31:55;2024-01-15 08:23:21;;;;;144;;Ecol.

Studies of mussels as ecosystem engineers have been conducted mostly in the rocky intertidal zone, while those in sedimentary intertidals have been relatively scarce. The present study assessed the effect of varying densities of Brachidontes rodriguezii on local environmental variables (substrate weight, water content, organic matter, weight of sediments adhering to mussel byssus) and ecological attributes of the associated community (richness, abundance, diversity, evenness, and assemblage structure) at different intertidal levels, sites, and seasons, in a mixed-sediment intertidal region in San Antonio Bay (Patagonia, Argentina). We performed two independent manipulative field experiments at low and mid intertidal levels at two sites -Punta Verde (PV), with relatively higher current velocities and coarser grain sizes than Punta Delgado (PD)- in both winter and summer. Manipulative experiments consisted in reducing mussel density to 50% in the low intertidal and increasing that density to up to 100% in the mid zone. We hypothesized that local environmental variables and ecological attributes associated with B. rodriguezii depended on mussel density. The reduction in B. rodriguezii density increased the evenness and reduced the abundance at PD plus reduced the richness at PV. Also, when reducing mussel density, the assemblage structure differed in water content and organic matter at both sites between treatments and seasons. The sediment weight adhering to mussel byssus in PD and substrate weight in PV were the best descriptors of the assemblages. The increase in mussel density, however, produced a weak effect on the ecological attributes of the community, and the assemblage structure did not correlate with the environmental variables considered. Our results demonstrated a stronger engineering effect of B. rodriguezii at reduced, but not increased, mussel density. This study revealed that the ecological attributes associated with B. rodriguezii both were density-dependent and varied with sites along the year in mixed-sediment intertidal zones. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.;2022;2023-07-04 07:31:57;2024-04-17 12:10:13;;;;;554;;J.

This study aims to provide insight on the functional diversity of polychaetes communities, a dominant benthic group, between the different habitat types of P. oceanica (plain meadow, strips/patches and dead matte), as well as pilot indicators of habitat modification. The results showed how specific traits relate to the different habitat types. Plain meadow was different to strips/patches and dead matte in functional composition, diversity and thus, the ecosystem functions involved. However, an overlap was observed in functional composition between dead matte and living P. oceanica, due to the remaining matte structure. This highlights the importance of the former on ecosystem functioning and the serious consequences of its current exclusion from conservational legislation. In addition, the classification of species to ecosystem engineering types showed interesting potential as an indicator. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd;2022;2023-07-04 07:32:01;2024-01-15 08:17:30;;;;;181;;Mar.

Due to global loss of seagrass, conservation and restoration incentives are rapidly increasing. However, it is not well understood how environmental setting affects the structural and functional diversity of macrofaunal communities in eelgrass meadows (Zostera marina), and to what extent their importance as macrofaunal habitat is affected by abiotic variables across spatial scales. In the present study, we explored macrofaunal communities in eelgrass meadows and adjacent bare habitats across contrasting environments in Southern Sweden. We assessed taxonomic and functional diversity in concert and evaluated environmental properties as explanatory variables for the observed differences. Our results showed that eelgrass meadows supported a significantly higher taxonomic richness and abundance compared to adjacent bare sediments whereas differences in structural and functional diversity was mainly a function of site and highly influenced by dominance of the polychaete Pygospio elegans. Interestingly, functional redundancy was higher in brackish compared to marine sites, illustrating the effect of generalist species that cover a wide range of functional traits. Abiotic sediment variables did not explain the variation in structural or functional diversity, but were largely overshadowed by the effect of eelgrass and its belowground biomass. From a restoration perspective, our results imply that the positive effects of eelgrass restoration are similar across environments and that the presence of eelgrass is the most important factor in structuring benthic communities, but the effects on functional diversity and redundancy need further attention. © 2022 The Authors;2022;2023-07-04 07:32:01;2024-01-10 13:56:43;;;;;554;;J.

The NW Atlantic coast hosts a cold-temperate biota, although knowledge about its biogeography is patchy. This study documents for the first time biogeographic variation at mid-to-high intertidal elevations in wave-exposed rocky intertidal habitats along the open Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia (Canada), a hydrographically distinct subregion of this cold-temperate region. For this goal, we measured the summer abundance of algae and invertebrates at the same nine locations over four consecutive years (2014 to 2017) spanning 415 km of coastline, which allowed us to examine latitudinal and interannual patterns. In addition, we looked for mensurative evidence on possible drivers underlying these patterns, focusing on sea surface temperature, daily maximum and minimum temperature (which often happen at low tides at thus differ from sea surface temperature), pelagic food supply for intertidal filter-feeders (phytoplankton abundance and particulate organic carbon), drift sea ice during the cold season (which can cause intertidal disturbance), and species associations. Our field surveys revealed that northern locations can be severely disturbed by ice scour when drift ice is abundant and, while biological recolonization occurs over the years, it differs in pace among locations. Southern locations, instead, did not experience ice scour during our study and, thus, generally exhibited a higher species richness and abundance than northern locations. Multivariate analyses indicated that the aforementioned expressions of temperature and pelagic food supply explained together 32–55% of the variation in alongshore biogeographic pattern, depending on the year. Species association analyses suggest that algal foundation species (generally more abundant at southern locations) contribute to increase location-wise species richness. Mensurative evidence for bottom-up forcing in seaweed–herbivore and filter-feeder–predator systems differed greatly among years. Overall, in addition to its inherent value to advance NW Atlantic intertidal biogeography, our species distribution database should be valuable to assess ecological change decades into the future as climate change and other anthropogenic influences unfold.

Here, we manipulated the richness of habitat-forming seaweeds in a western Atlantic estuary to explore how changes in foundation species diversity affect the structure and functioning of the benthic consumer communities that they support. Structural equation modeling revealed that macroalgal richness enhanced invertebrate abundance, biomass, and diversity, both directly by changing the quality and palatability of the foundational substrate and indirectly by increasing the total biomass of available habitat. Consumer responses were largely driven by a single foundational seaweed, although stronger complementarity among macroalgae was observed for invertebrate richness. These findings with diverse foundational phyla extend earlier inferences from terrestrial grasslands by showing that biodiversity effects can simultaneously propagate through multiple independent pathways to maintain animal foodwebs. Our work also highlights the potential ramifications of human-induced changes in marine ecosystems. © 2022 The Authors.

These impacts cause changes in the distribution of biodiversity and key ecological functions, modifications to food webs and reductions in ecosystem condition and seascape connectivity. Understanding whether, and how, the spatial context (i.e. extent, position) and condition (i.e. structure and condition of patches, including habitat forming species) of ecosystems coalesce to support their function as animal habitats is critical for effective and cost efficient coastal management. These potential combined, or interactive, effects of spatial context and habitat condition on fish assemblages are, however, rarely quantified. We sampled fish assemblages from six different ecosystems (mangrove, seagrass, saltmarsh, log snag, rocky outcrop and unvegetated sediment) across 13 estuaries in eastern Australia and quantified the relative importance of spatial context and habitat condition variables for fish assemblage composition. Spatial context variables were consistently more important than habitat condition in structuring fish abundance and diversity. Sites that were closer to smaller vegetated habitats (i.e. mangrove and seagrass) and key seascape features (i.e. estuary mouth and intertidal flats) typically supported diverse fish assemblages in high abundance. While the composition of fish assemblages was primarily linked to spatial context variables, habitat condition variables that index food availability were also important for fish in mangroves, seagrass and rocky outcrops. Our results show that fish abundance and diversity are intimately linked to seascape connectivity and heterogeneity, and have important implications for conservation planning and fisheries management decisions in coastal ecosystems. We highlight the importance of quantifying the influence of the combined effects of habitat condition and spatial context for biodiversity across multiple ecosystems, and expect the outcomes to lead to more efficient and effective management planning. © 2022 The Authors.

Brown algae, Fucus vesiculosus, and blue mussels, Mytilus trossulus, coexist on sheltered and moderately wave exposed shallow rocky reefs of the northern Baltic Proper. Here, they function as important biogenic structures for an abundant associated macroinvertebrate fauna. Despite their dominance and space sympatry, there is little understanding of how they differ in their role as provisioners of biodiversity in this system. While Fucus has been recognized as an important habitat provider for decades, the similar role of blue mussels has been seriously understudied in the northern Baltic Proper, leading to pressing knowledge gaps and an underestimation of their role for overall biodiversity. In this study, we compared macroinvertebrate species assemblages within 40 rocky reefs where Fucus and Mytilus co-occur in either intermixed or adjacent assemblages. We show that both habitats represent a species rich and abundant community that are comparable regarding diversity. However, abundance and biomass of the associated community is much higher in the Mytilus habitat in relation to the Fucus habitat, implying a far higher secondary production in the former habitat. Recognizing key habitats and understanding how they differ in their ability to support biodiversity and ecosystem productivity is necessary for predicting community responses to human pressures, including an altered climate, and for implementing efficient mitigation actions to minimize loss of biodiversity.

Within benthic marine ecosystems, foundation species such as canopy-forming macro-algae often underpin important cascades of facilitative interactions. We examined the wider impacts of climate-driven shifts in the relative abundances of foundation species within a temperate reef system, with particular focus on a habitat cascade whereby kelp facilitate epiphytic algae that, in turn, facilitate mobile invertebrates. Specifically, we tested whether the warm-water kelp Laminaria ochroleuca, which has proliferated in response to recent warming trends, facilitated a secondary habitat-former (epiphytic algae on stipes) and associated mobile invertebrates, to the same degree as the cold-water kelp Laminaria hyperborea. The facilitative interaction between kelp and stipe-associated epiphytic algae was dramatically weaker for the warm-water foundation species, leading to breakdown of a habitat cascade and impoverished associated faunal assemblages. On average, the warm-water kelp supported >250 times less epiphytic algae (by biomass) and >50 times fewer mobile invertebrates (by abundance) than the cold-water kelp. Moreover, by comparing regions of pre- and post-range expansion by L. ochroleuca, we found that warming-impacted kelp forests supported around half the biomass of epiphytic algae and one-fifth of the abundance of mobile invertebrates, per unit area, compared with unimpacted forests. We suggest that disruption to this facilitation cascade has the potential to impact upon higher trophic levels, specifically kelp forest fishes, through lower prey availability. Synthesis. Climate-driven shifts in species' distributions and the relative abundances of foundation organisms will restructure communities and alter ecological interactions, with consequences for ecosystem functioning. We show that climate-driven substitutions of seemingly similar foundation species can alter local biodiversity and trophic processes in temperate marine ecosystems. © 2022 The Authors.

This trend has created a data gap on the role more remote eelgrass beds provide among the mosaic of other temperate marine habitats. In this study, we surveyed 15 Z. marina and Z. pacifica beds along Catalina Island and the Southern California Bight (SCB) mainland coast from 2018 to 2020 for areal coverage, structural components and fish assemblages, from which a relativized index of fish utilization was then created. We then evaluated the landscape and structural components that potentially drive fish utilization in Z. marina using the index as a response variable in a model selection procedure. Zostera beds ranged in size from 0.06 ha to > 27.5 ha. Fish assemblages in Z. marina and Z. pacifica beds were significantly different, and in the case of fishes found in both, individuals were often below size at maturity in Z. marina and above size in Z. pacifica. Distance to the nearest reef and bed area, both positively related to the fish assemblage index, were the most important factors. The results suggest Z. marina beds function as a nursery habitat while Z. pacifica are used by mid-level predators for foraging. These data represent the first rigorous study of fish utilization of open-coast Z. marina and Z. pacifica beds, and are invaluable to marine spatial planning efforts that may incorporate a more holistic approach to habitat management in temperate regions. © Inter-Research 2022.;2022;2023-07-04 07:32:15;2024-04-17 14:22:32;;15-27;;;696;;Mar.

Pelvetiopsis californica is an upper intertidal rockweed endemic to California (USA) and Baja California (MEX) with little known about its distribution and abundance, nor its ecological role as a habitat former. We examined long-term changes in the abundance and distribution of P. californica and its effects on the upper shore community, along the coast of California. Similar to patterns observed in other rockweeds globally, P. californica has declined over the past several decades, including extirpation at 30% of sites sampled, clustered around urban centers of southern California, and a large decline in abundance at most sites from a long-term (~ 20 + years) monitoring program. Currently, P. californica exhibits a patchy distribution, particularly in southern California where it is absent from long stretches of shoreline. In community surveys across a large geographic scale (32°–36° latitude), high zone community composition was significantly different at sites where P. californica was present, even at relatively low cover, than when the alga was absent. Within-site community surveys also showed that communities associated with P. californica were different than when the rockweed was absent, highlighted by a higher diversity of algae and invertebrates. Probable stressors, such as trampling and climate change, are likely to worsen in the future, further reducing P. californica populations. Due to limited reproductive dispersal capabilities and fragmented populations, natural recovery seems unlikely and active restoration may be necessary. © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.";2022;2023-07-04 07:32:18;2024-01-15 08:31:27;;;;3;169;;Mar.

While temperature plays a key role in structuring species distributions, less is known about how species’ early life stages are responding to warming-induced changes in preferred nursery habitat availability. We aim to identify key ecological and environmental drivers of juvenile reef fishes’ distributions in the context of ocean warming. Location: South-eastern Australian coastline from 30 to 37°S. Methods: We used a decade of underwater visual census data to uncover latitudinal distribution patterns of juvenile reef fishes and habitats across 1000 km of coastline, from subtropical to temperate latitudes. We modelled how benthic habitat cover, depth, wave exposure and sea surface temperature influence distributions of warm-water and cool-water juvenile reef fishes on temperate rocky reefs. Results: We found sea surface temperature was typically the most important factor influencing densities of juvenile fishes, regardless of species’ thermal affinity or latitudinal range extent. Juveniles of tropical and subtropical range-expanding fishes responded more strongly to warmer temperatures and lower wave exposure, while juveniles of temperate species responded more strongly to benthic habitats. Species’ responses to greater availability of temperate reef habitat-formers such as kelp and other macroalgae contrasted, being positive for temperate and negative for tropical and subtropical juvenile fishes. Main conclusions: The availability of both suitable habitat and sea temperatures for species’ early life stages is important considerations when predicting changes in reef fishes’ distributions in the context of ocean warming. Warming-induced isotherm shifts and feedback loops constraining the persistence of key temperate reef habitat-formers will favour range-expanding tropical reef fishes colonizing higher-latitude reefs, while disadvantaging some macroalgal-associated resident temperate species. Such varying responses to warming-induced environmental changes may strongly influence the structure of emerging tropicalized reef assemblages. © 2022 The Authors.

Benthic filter feeders (e.g., mussels) provide several services for coastal regions, including improving water quality by reducing eutrophication, being a major source of food for humans, and as a habitat-forming species. Here, we seek to understand the role of benthic filter feeders in enhancing water quality in an urban coastal system in order to assess their role as ecosystem service providers and how they should be included in ecosystem-based evaluations. Using as a model False Bay, South Africa's largest natural bay and a socio-economic hotspot, this multidisciplinary study was designed to identify possible pollution sources to a highly-urbanised coastal region, assess their effects on several biological and biogeochemical parameters, and evaluate the role of mussels in mitigating these anthropogenic inputs. We consider several sources of pollution, including nutrient loading from wastewater and river outflows, heavy metals, and aerosol deposition. We find that pollutant inputs are largely attenuated by the circulation of the bay and by the presence of filter feeders that bioaccumulate contaminants, thereby removing them from coastal waters. Our work thus emphasizes the potential for mussels and natural abiotic processes to ameliorate anthropogenic impacts, although these mitigation strategies are not without environmental risk. We recommend that such information should be included in national assessments used to develop appropriate strategies and policies for coastal environmental management and conservation. © 2022 The Authors;2022;2023-07-04 07:32:20;2024-01-10 10:20:42;;;;;139;;Ecol.

Here, we used experimental manipulations to test the hypotheses that ocean warming and acidification would negatively affect habitat-forming coralline algal turfs and the diverse molluscan assemblages they support. Boulders covered in a turf of Amphiroa anceps with intact faunal assemblages were subjected to an orthogonal combination of current (~ 23 °C) and future (~ 26 °C) ocean temperatures, and current (~ 430 µatm) and future (~ 880 µatm) seawater pCO2. Ocean warming negatively impacted the cover and photosynthetic efficiency of Amphiroa fronds, whereas ocean acidification caused the biomass per unit area and the frond density of Amphiroa turf to be 56% and 59% less than current ocean conditions, respectively. Ocean acidification also caused a significant change in the structure of molluscan assemblages associated with Amphiroa turf, which included a 43% and a 61% reduction in the species richness and overall abundance of molluscs, respectively. The results demonstrate that coralline algal turfs are particularly vulnerable to ocean climate change, which has implications for the biodiversity and ecosystem functions supported by these globally distributed foundation species. © 2022;2022;2023-07-04 07:32:22;2024-01-15 08:10:21;;;;;35;;Glob.

Such frameworks are important benthic ecosystems, but knowledge of them is fairly limited in the Arabian Gulf, the hottest sea in the world. In this study, the presence of macroalgae, bryozoans, sponges, and gorgonian corals was discovered in the seabed of the western Arabian Gulf. These organisms had positive co-occurrences with a preference for depths of 20 to 50 m. A hotspot of spatial distribution of macroalgae and bryozoans was also identified, located in the northwestern part of the Arabian Gulf. These habitat-forming organisms were distributed in a patchy pattern with low to moderate levels of density. They were positively associated with several commercial fishes, suggesting their importance to fishery.

Seasonal random sampling (winter, spring and summer) was conducted on oyster reefs and the nearby bare sediment and cordgrass areas. The habitat showed different structures with a wide size range of available spaces for macrofaunal colonization. Fifty-three macrofaunal species were recorded. Thirty-five percent of them were native, 3% were cryptogenic, 5% were exotic, and 54% need further taxonomic determination. All of the exotic species were found in reefs; though the amphipod Monocorophium insidiosum (Crawford, 1937) also settled on soft and cordgrass sediments. Species assemblages changed across seasons. Diversity was higher in reefs than in cordgrass or bare sediments during the warm season. There were no differences in the proportion of trophic groups. Our results suggest that C. gigas restructures the macrofaunal species assemblages and that this effect is driven by seasonality. In Los Pocitos, oyster reefs currently show a primary role as a suitable habitat for many species, but the net impacts of the invasion of this ecosystem engineer, including the cascading effects on the food web or the facilitation of further invasions remain unclear. The mechanisms and net effects of this restructuring force need further attention. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd";2022;2023-07-04 07:32:23;2024-01-15 08:59:39;;;;;270;;Estuar. Coast.

Restoration of foundation species promises to counter such losses, despite unknown recovery timelines, undefined benchmarks, and uncertainty about whether restored ecosystems approximate natural ones. Here, we demonstrate through a 15-year large-scale experiment in coastal Virginia, USA, that restored oyster reefs can quickly recover multiple ecological functions and match natural reefs. Specifically, abundances of oysters and a key crab mesopredator on restored reefs equaled reference reefs in approximately 6 years, indicating that restoration can initiate rapid, sustained recovery of foundation species and associated consumers. As reefs matured and accrued biomass, they became more temporally stable, suggesting that restoration can increase resilience and may stabilize those ecosystem processes that scale with foundation species biomass. Together, these results demonstrate that restoration can catalyze rapid recovery of imperiled coastal foundation species, reclaim lost community interactions, and help reverse decades of degradation. © 2022 The Authors.

In this framework of biodiversity decline, organisms that provide biogenic habitat play a relevant role by their capacity to structure assemblages and influence ecological processes. The Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is considered an ecosystem engineer because it alters local environmental conditions maintaining habitat suitability for other organisms, and enhancing local biodiversity. Although it is widely recognized that mussel beds increase diversity, the drivers shaping these assemblages are poorly explored. We investigate whether mussel size homogenisation shapes the abundance, richness and structure of macrobenthic assemblages associated with mussel beds in two shores of the Galician coast (NW Spain). At each shore, two sites, 10 m apart, were selected and at each site, faunal assemblages were compared between mussel clumps showing shells of various sizes (control), and mussel clumps with closely similar-sized mussels, considered as homogenised. Homogenised clumps showed, in general, higher values in total number of individuals and species than control clumps. Regarding the effect of mussel size homogenisation on the multivariate structure of the assemblages, significant differences between control and homogenised clumps were found in three out of the four sites. Most relevant associated species usually reached higher abundances in homogenised clumps than control ones. Therefore, mussel size homogenisation influenced the structure of the macrofaunal assemblages associated with mussel beds but, its effect was context dependent (i.e., varied with sites). Information about the species contribution to dissimilarities among homogenised and control clumps was provided and the potential influence of sediment and algae on mussel clumps was discussed. © 2022 Veiga et al.

Its occurrence in the Tavolara–Punta Coda Cavallo Marine Protected Area (NE Sardinia) has never been deeply investigated despite this area being well known from a biocoe-notic point of view. This study provides new information on the size of the colonies settled between 35 and 59 m depth on granitic outcrops and represents a contribution to highlighting the hotspot of megabenthic diversity enclosed in the protected area. The presence of 100 colonies was assessed by photographic samplings performed between 2015 and 2020, in a small area characterized by pecu-liar ecological conditions. The morphometric descriptions and age estimation showed a persistently isolated population probably derived from a stochastic event of settling of larvae presumably com-ing from the Tuscany Archipelago. A richly associated epibiotic community, composed of 18 spe-cies/OTUs, showed how branched bryozoans, particularly Turbicellepora avicularis, and the parasitic octocoral Alcyonium coralloides, affected the colonies’ branches, suggesting a putative anthropogenic impact related to fishing activity. This study indicates that proper protection and management strategies are mandatory for the Marine Protected Area, in order to conserve this unique population and the whole associated benthic assemblage. © 2022 by the authors.

Seagrass meadows are key shallow coastal habitats that provide critical ecosystem services worldwide, and they are threatened by the arrival of non-native macroalgae. Here, we examined the effects of Halimeda incrassata, a tropical alga that has recently colonized the Mediterranean Sea, on epifaunal assemblages associated with Cymodocea nodosa seagrass meadows of Mallorca Island (Western Mediterranean Sea). This invasive macroalga is an ecological engineer and thus has a high potential of modifying native habitats. A seagrass meadow colonized by H. incrassata exhibited important changes on associated epifaunal assemblages, with an increase in abundance and diversity, particularly driven by higher abundances of Gammaridae, Polychaeta, Copepoda and Caprellidae. Given the key ecological contribution of epifauna to food webs, these alterations will likely have important implications for overall food web structure and ecosystem functioning of native ecosystems.

To what spatial extent oyster reefs influence surrounding infauna and sediment composition remains uncertain. We sampled sediment and infauna across 8 intertidal mudflats at distances up to 100 m from oyster reefs within coastal bays of Virginia, USA, to determine if distance from reefs and physical site characteristics (reef elevation, local hydrodynamics, and oyster cover) explain the spatial distributions of infauna and sediment. Total infauna density increased with distance away from reefs; however, the opposite was observed for predatory crustaceans (primarily crabs). Our results indicate a halo surrounding the reefs of approximately 40 m (using an increase in ~25% of observance as the halo criterion). At 90 m from reefs, bivalves and gastropods were 70% more likely to be found (probability of observance), while there was an approximate 4-fold decrease for large crustaceans compared to locations adjacent to reefs. Increases in percent oyster reef cover and/or mean reef area did not statistically alter infauna densities but showed a statistical correlation with smaller sediment grain size, increased organic matter, and reduced flow rates. Weaker flow conditions within the surrounding mudflats were also associated with smaller grain sizes and higher organic matter content, suggesting multiple drivers on the spatial distribution of sediment composition. This study emphasizes the complexity of bio-physical couplings and the considerable spatial extent over which oyster reefs engineer intertidal communities. © Inter-Research 2022";2022;2023-07-04 07:32:34;2024-01-15 08:26:15;;91-106;;;686;;Mar.

We examined the nature of the impact of C. filiformis meadows on the density, taxonomic richness and assemblage structure of epifaunal and infaunal benthic macroinvertebrates. Specifically, we tested whether the spread of C. filiformis has resulted in different macroinvertebrate assemblages than those formed by the dominant native macroalgae (i.e., Rhodymenia spp.) and unvegetated sediments. Surveys were undertaken in two bays in each of two locations, in central and southern Peru, during winter 2017 and summer 2018. In general, our results show that macroinvertebrate assemblages were similar across all three habitats, although there were some differences, related to location and time, but with no clear patterns observed. Taxonomic richness and density was generally higher in the vegetated habitats than the unvegetated habitat, and where there were differences between the two vegetated habitats there was no consistent pattern of which habitat supported the highest richness or density. Given invading C. filiformis is primarily colonizing unvegetated habitats it would appear that this species is creating a new niche which supports similar assemblages, but higher taxonomic richness and density than unvegetated habitats. While our study suggests that C. filiformis is having a limited ecological impact we recommend that actions be put in place to limit the spread of this invasive species at the same time as increasing monitoring of the ecological impacts of this species as lags in the ecological impacts of invasive species are common. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;2022;2023-07-04 07:32:35;2024-07-12 13:23:52;;;;;;;Biol.

In such environments, the provision of cool microclimates by habitat-forming species enables persistence of associated species during high temperature events. We assessed whether, by maintaining cool microclimates through heat events, habitat formed by rock oysters (Saccostrea cucullata) provides temporal stability to associated invertebrate communities over periods of extreme temperatures. On three tropical rocky shores of Hong Kong, which experiences a monsoonal climate, we compared changes in microclimates and invertebrate communities associated with oyster and bare rock habitats between the cool and hot seasons. Oyster habitats were, across both seasons, consistently characterised by lower maximum temperatures and greater thermal stability than bare rock habitats. Invertebrate communities in the bare rock habitat were less diverse and abundant in the hot than the cool season, but communities in the cooler habitats provided by oysters did not display temporal change. These results demonstrate that microclimates formed by oysters provide temporal stability to associated communities across periods of temperature change and are key determinants of species distributions in thermally stressful environments. The conservation and restoration of oyster habitats may, therefore, build resilience in associated ecological communities subject to ongoing environmental change. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd;2022;2023-07-04 07:32:38;2024-01-10 13:47:00;;;;;173;;Mar.

However, global warming can alter this multifunctionality, by modifying engineer co-existence and the diversity of functional traits present in a landscape. This is mediated by warming favoring retention of traits of tolerant engineers over sensitive ones and functional characteristics of residents nested within engineered patches. This study aims to test the influence of warming on co-existence of two sympatric autogenic engineers (seagrass Zostera capensis and red macroalga Gracilaria gracilis) that co-occur in intertidal sandflats of Langebaan Lagoon, on the west coast of South Africa. Findings from mesocosm experiments indicate that increasing temperature to maximum levels recorded in situ is linked to greater seagrass senescence (80–93%) and epiphytic fouling (80–86%) relative to low temperatures. Warming was associated with greater biomass of G. gracilis (30–45%) relative to controls, despite it incurring greater fouling levels (55–60%) and potentially light reduction. In situ comparisons of functional traits and community metrics of macrofauna inhabiting beds of Zostera and Gracilaria and unvegetated sandflats, indicated unique assemblages in Zostera habitats and a dominance of surface-dwelling fauna. Macrofaunal abundance was reduced in Gracilaria beds (72%) and unvegetated sandflats (47%), which were dominated by burrowing infauna. Findings indicate that warming in temperate coastal systems may lead to seagrass declines, but increased cover of G. gracilis. This shift would likely lower ecosystem heterogeneity, given the faunal similarity between unvegetated sandflats and Gracilaria beds that was recorded, while reducing habitat for critically endangered specialist seagrass inhabitants. © 2021, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.;2022;2023-07-04 07:32:39;2024-01-15 08:52:38;;247-259;;1;45;;Estuar.

Restoring oyster reefs and monitoring restoration success often focuses on oyster metrics, but relatively infrequently, responses of higher trophic level species and the production of related ecosystem services are accounted for. To address this, we compare the response of a resident reef fish guild (gobies, blennies, toadfish) to standard metrics of oyster restoration success. Using lift nets and seines, natural and restored reefs were monitored over a two-year period within Mosquito Lagoon, Florida, USA. Standard metrics are indicative of restoration success; live oyster density and reef thickness increased in restored reefs after 12 and 24 months. Combined, live oyster density and reef thickness were the best predictors of annual resident reef fish abundance compared to water quality metrics. These results suggest that the benefits of restoring oyster reef habitat are conferred to broader components of the food web, with benefits accruing to reef resident fishes that are a key trophic linkage between lower trophic level foundation species and higher trophic level predators inhabiting coastal ecosystems. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the drivers of biodiversity change across the euphotic mesophotic transition remain unclear. Here, we investigated the mechanisms affecting the biodiversity-supporting potential of free-living red coralline algae globally important habitat creators towards mesophotic depths. Across a 73 m depth gradient, we observed a general decline in macrofaunal biodiversity (fauna abundance, taxon richness and alphadiversity), but an increase in beta-diversity (i.e. variation between assemblages) at the deepest site (86 mdepth, where light levelswere less than 1% surface irradiance).We identified a gradient in abundance decline rather than distinct ecological shifts, driven by a complex interaction between declining light availability, declining size of the coralline algal host individuals and a changing host taxonomy. However, despite abundance declines, high betweenassemblage variability at deeper depths allowed biodiversity-supporting potential to be maintained, highlighting their importance as coastal refugia. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing.

At many of their warm range edges, cool-water kelps are decreasing, while seaweeds with warm-water affinities are increasing. These habitat-forming species provide different ecological functions, and shifts to warm-affinity seaweeds are expected to modify the structure of associated communities. Predicting the nature of such shifts at the ecosystem level is, however, challenging, as they often occur gradually over large geographical areas. Here, we take advantage of a climatic transition zone, where cool-affinity (kelp) and warm-affinity (Sargassum) seaweed forests occur adjacently under similar environmental conditions, to test whether these seaweed habitats support different associated seaweed, invertebrate, coral, and fish assemblages. We found clear differences in associated seaweed assemblages between habitats characterized by kelp and Sargassum abundance, with kelp having higher biomass and seaweed diversity and more cool-affinity species than Sargassum habitats. The multivariate invertebrate and fish assemblages were not different between habitats, despite a higher diversity of fish species in the Sargassum habitat. No pattern in temperature affinity of the invertebrate or fish assemblages in each habitat was found, and few fish species were exclusive to one habitat or the other. These findings suggest that, as ocean warming continues to replace kelps with Sargassum, the abundance and diversity of associated seaweeds could decrease, whereas fish could increase. Nevertheless, the more tropicalized seaweed habitats may provide a degree of functional redundancy to associated fauna in temperate seaweed habitats. © 2022 The Authors.

These habitats are under increasing anthropogenic stress, and understanding their dynamics is a prerequisite for management and conservation. In this study, we examined the effects of isolation of the bay from the sea, water and sediment characteristics, and macrophyte species on the invertebrate communities. In each bay, both epifauna and infauna were sampled in pairs of monospecific patches of dominating habitat-forming macrophytes (Stuckenia pectinata, Chara tomentosa and Ceratophyllum demersum). We found that the invertebrate community was mainly affected by bay isolation, which correlated with other environmental variables, and thus likely drives many processes in the bays. Further, the epifauna community responded to both the median grainsize and geometric standard deviation across both the isolation gradient (S. pectinata alone) and in the S. pectinata - C. demersum macrophyte pair, whereas the median grainsize affected the epifauna in the S. pectinata - C. tomentosa macrophyte pair. The infauna community responded to either the median grainsize or the geometric standard deviation across the isolation gradient and in both macrophyte pairs. Only minor differences between the dominating macrophyte species were seen regarding invertebrate abundance, taxon richness and diversity, although the more structurally complex C. demersum supported the highest epifauna diversity and lowest infauna abundance. However, at local, within bay scale, epifauna communities varied between most pairs of macrophyte species, suggesting that habitat-forming macrophytes have important roles in structuring local invertebrate community patterns. This study emphasizes the complexity of biotic and abiotic interactions within and among shallow coastal bays, and the challenges with studying and comparing processes in these unique ecosystems. © 2021;2021;2023-07-04 07:32:45;2024-07-15 12:25:00;;;;;262;;Estuar.

Aims: The present study aims to compare the amphipod assemblages associated with the dominant canopy-forming macroalgae in shallow subtidal habitats of the Alboran Sea, as well as to explore its biogeographical patterns and the influence of protection measures. Methods: Replicate samples of both Ericaria selaginoides (=Cystoseira tamariscifolia) and Halopteris scoparia were collected at two different bioregions within the Alboran Sea and both inside and outside marine protected areas. Key results: Amphipoda was the dominant taxon within the mobile epifaunal community, both in terms of number of species (47 different species were recorded) and individuals (>70% of the total abundance). Assemblages associated with E. selaginoides and H. scoparia differed and showed a marked response to the Mediterranean-Atlantic gradient in this region; species related to warmer waters become increasingly dominant towards the east. However, there were no significant differences in amphipod assemblage composition, abundance or species richness between protected and non-protected areas. Conclusions: Obtained results highlighted the relevance of these native macroalgae as habitat for epifauna, as well as the influence of macroalgal identity and regional biogeographical patterns on amphipod distribution. Implications: This study provides valuable baseline information to monitor human-induced changes such as coastal pollution, invasive species, and climate change. It also draws attention about the uncertain response of epifaunal communities to management strategies (such as marine protected areas) and ecological processes (e.g. increasing predation pressure). © 2022.";2022;2023-07-04 07:32:46;2024-01-10 13:26:44;;;;;;;Mar.

Overall, fluctuations in algae biomass inflict fluctuations in the abundance of the associated mobile macrofauna, but the structure of the community may vary according to how each group/species uses the resources provided by the algal habitat. Here, we evaluated how temporal variations in the biomass of Sargassum algal bed (increase, decrease, or maintenance) can affect the abundance, density, and assemblage structure of distinct associated faunistic groups. The collections were performed in three rocky shores located on the north coast of São Paulo, southeastern Brazil, during Fall and Spring. We observed different patterns of algal substrate variation between sampling events, and this reflected on variable effects on the associated fauna. The algal substrate reduction was accompanied by the reduction in the abundance and density of all associated faunal groups. However, the increase or maintenance of the algal substrate was accompanied by an increase in the abundance of peracarids, due to the dominance of herbivorous species, while other taxonomic groups like mollusks and polychaetes decreased or maintained their abundance, although with higher species evenness of gastropods when alga increases. Seasonal biomass variations in macroalgae beds are relevant for the dynamics of its associated fauna, and our results indicate that some taxonomic groups may preferentially use the available extra resources originated from biomass increment when compared to other groups. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH;2021;2023-07-04 07:32:47;2024-01-15 12:24:52;;;;3;42;;Mar.

In marine soft-bottoms in particular, the biodiversity sustained by a matrix of relatively uniform sediments can be drastically enhanced by the presence of ecosystem engineers such as seagrasses. Unfortunately, the influence of seagrass meadows on the diversity of surrounding sediments is often unrecognized in spite of its importance, especially in coastlines exposed to multiple sources of pollution. This study examined composition and diversity associated with a bed of Zostera noltei Hornemann, 1832, and its surrounding bare sediments in a highly urbanized coastal area of the Romanian Black Sea. Dissimilarity levels were quantified and key species driving the differences between uniform (bare) and complex (eelgrass) sedimentary habitats were identified. 48 taxa were collected and counted, with epifaunal and infaunal species each accounting for nearly half of that diversity. Abundance, richness and diversity were strikingly higher in eelgrass-associated sediments, a difference driven primarily by various species of snails, crustaceans, polychaetes and bivalves. Between-habitat differences remained significant even after the removal of epifaunal species and each dataset undergoing strong data transformation. These results suggest that even small eelgrass beds, located in the vicinity of multiple sources of stress, can act as hotspots and make a substantial contribution to local benthic diversity. © Copyright © 2021 Surugiu, Teacă, Şvedu and Quijón.;2021;2023-07-04 07:32:48;2024-01-15 09:22:38;;;;;8;;Front.

However, high-resolution information on assemblages associated with macroalgae is lacking for many species and regions. Saccorhiza polyschides is a warm-temperate kelp with a relatively short lifespan (12-18 months), large thallus and bulbous holdfast offering habitat for diverse assemblages. In the UK, S. polyschides populations are thought to have proliferated recently. Here, we quantified the density and habitat structure provided by S. polyschides along a gradient of wave exposure within Plymouth Sound, and examined the composition and diversity of associated faunal assemblages. Density varied significantly between sites but not by wave exposure, while biometric measurements were generally highly variable. Senescing holdfasts from sporophytes offered valuable habitat, with high abundance and richness of associated assemblages, although these varied markedly between sporophytes and sites. Faunal abundance, taxon richness and diversity were significantly higher at fully exposed sites than at moderately exposed sites. Internal volume of holdfasts was positively correlated with faunal abundance and taxon richness. We recorded more than 27 distinct taxa and up to ~600 individuals within a single holdfast. Taxa included three fish species, including a novel observation of the pipefish Nerophis lumbriciformis. Further work is needed to examine seasonality in habitat structure and associated diversity patterns but our study demonstrates that even remnant holdfasts from decaying sporophytes represent a valuable microhabitat that may provide shelter, protection and food during winter.

Spatial variation in the role of seagrass beds in enhancing biodiversity is poorly resolved, limiting our ability to set priorities for conservation and restoration. We aimed to model the biodiversity enhancement value of seagrass beds. Location: Florida Gulf Coast, USA. Methods: We used generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to describe the distribution, total cover and species composition of seagrass beds and to estimate their effects on spatial patterns of faunal species richness under three scenarios. Specifically, we: (a) quantified the biodiversity enhancement value of current seagrass beds, (b) inferred the biodiversity value of potential restoration areas and (c) projected potential changes in the distribution and biodiversity enhancement value of seagrass beds due to SLR using low (+0.50 m) and high (+1.0 m) SLR forecasts for 2100. Results: Current seagrass beds supported 43%–64% more species than unvegetated habitats, even when accounting for spatial variability in predicted faunal richness due to other environmental, seascape, temporal and geographic factors. Seagrass restoration in potential habitats would also increase biodiversity in the near-term (i.e., 43%–45% above unvegetated levels). However, model projections indicate that SLR could result in significant losses of current seagrass beds and potential restoration areas, causing contracted distributions and lower seagrass cover. Overall, these changes could result in significant reductions in the enhancement value provided by seagrasses. Although, there could also be many suitable locations for seagrasses by 2100, with some having either comparable or potentially increased enhancement value. Main conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance of considering spatial variation in biodiversity benefits when planning for seagrass conservation and restoration and when managing the impacts of SLR. © 2021 The Authors.

Variability at multiple spatial scales is a driver of biodiversity, but our understanding of the response of macrofauna communities to variability of seagrass meadows is limited. We examined the macrofauna community structure (abundance and biomass) and diversity patterns (α- and β-diversity) across a seascape gradient of eleven seagrass meadows differing in the number, composition and density of plant species. The variability of the macrobenthic communities was regulated by a combination of sedimentary (mainly for the infauna) and macrophyte (mainly for the epifauna) predictors. We demonstrate that the natural occurrence of drifting algae trapped in the aboveground complexity of the meadows benefits seagrass macrofauna. Seagrass-associated macrofauna showed a clear increase in abundance and α-diversity metrics with increasing habitat complexity attributes (i.e. shoot density, plant biomass and canopy height). Furthermore, partitioning of β-diversity (i.e. the variation of species composition between sites) implied the replacement of some species by others between sites (i.e. spatial turnover) instead of a process of species loss (or gain) from site to site (i.e. nestedness). Therefore, the enhancement of macrofauna diversity across an increasing gradient of seagrass complexity, and the dominance of the turnover component suggest that devoting conservation efforts on many different types of meadows, including the less diverse, should be a priority for coastal habitat-management. © 2021, The Author(s).;2021;2023-07-04 07:32:50;2024-07-15 12:01:20;;3023-3043;;11;30;;Biodiversity Conserv.;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Benthic; kelp forest; seagrass; biodiversity; community structure; fauna; marsh; seagrass meadow; species diversity; coral reef; Baltic Sea; community dynamics; macrophyte; Coastal habitats; habitat management; Community dynamics; conservation management; environmental conditions; Rhizophoraceae; α- and β-diversity; DEGRADATION; BENTHIC INVERTEBRATES; BETA-DIVERSITY; NESTEDNESS; FAUNA; STRATEGIES; ALGAL MATS; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; INFAUNAL COMMUNITIES; LANDSCAPES; alpha- and beta-diversity; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The decline of biogenic habitat structure, such as in kelp forests, coral reefs, mangroves or seagrass beds, often causes a local increase in water flow velocity and wave exposure. The impact of this change in hydrodynamics on the energy expenditure of animals is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that loss of seagrass beds increases water current velocity, which impacts associated pipefishes through increased energy expenditure. We correlated ventilation frequency with metabolic rate in four pipefish species, to be able to estimate metabolic rates in free-swimming fish. Using a hydrodynamic flume, we then experimentally tested the effect of current velocity and substrate (seagrass or sand) on ventilation frequency and behaviour. Ventilation frequency was consistently higher when they swam on sand substratum compared to seagrass substratum for all species, and this was especially noticeable for the species with prehensile tails (i.e. Nerophis ophidion). Seagrass canopies reduced flow velocities by 7%–44%, which increased the overall current exposure that pipefish tolerated. N. ophidion, Syngnathus rostellatus and Syngnathus typhle showed two behavioural responses to currents: holding on to the seagrass canopy, and moving to areas where the current was lower (i.e. bottom) in trials without seagrass. Most of the individuals of all species were unable to maintain position in velocities of 15–18 cm/s on sand substratum. In this work, we demonstrate the reliance on seagrass hydrodynamic shelter of four species of pipefish. Among them, N. ophidion showed the highest seagrass shelter dependence and vulnerability, while S. rostellatus and S. typhle are potentially more resilient to vegetation changes. Increased energy expenditure is thus another impact on fishes as seagrass beds and other structural habitats continue to decline in coastal areas.

Yet, a lack of information on how key habitat characteristics (e.g., area, vertical relief, age) influence the ability of restored habitats to deliver these ecosystem services hinders efforts to maximize the return on restoration investments. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the influence of reef type (natural or restored), taxa, and restored reef size, vertical relief, age, and tidal zone on the presence and magnitude of recruitment enhancement for nekton (i.e., fish and swimming crabs). Both intertidal and subtidal reefs, as well as restored and natural reefs, enhanced nekton recruitment, though there was variation among taxonomic groups with reef types. Recruitment enhancement was more common across taxa on restored (six families) than on natural (one family) reefs. Resident nekton families were more consistently enhanced than transient families. Nekton enhancement varied with a number of restored reef characteristics. Recruitment enhancement increased with greater reef size across taxa, decreased with higher vertical relief for two families, showed maximum recruitment around a single intertidal reef age for one family, and showed minimum recruitment around a single subtidal reef age for three families. Understanding variation across species in response to key design elements will improve restoration success and enhance return on investment. Moving forward, we recommend studies that vary reef habitat characteristics independently and in combination to identify how variation in these characteristics interact to influence nekton recruitment enhancement by oyster reefs. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America;2021;2023-07-04 07:32:54;2024-07-15 12:53:07;;;;5;31;;Ecol.

Among corals, octocorals are a diverse group of soft corals that are an integral part of reef ecosystems. In the present study, the association between two octocoral corals Pseudopterogorgia sp. Kükenthal, 1919 and Menella sp. Gray, 1870, and the cuttlefish Sepiella inermis were described from the intertidal region of the highly urbanized seascape of Mumbai, India. S. inermis used the octocorals as spawning substratum during their spawning season in October–November, 2020. Out of 92 octocoral colonies from two sites, 48.9% were found with cuttlefish egg capsules attached. 36 (57.14%) out of 63 colonies and 9 (31.03%) out of 29 colonies were hosted with cuttlefish eggs capsules at Marine Drive (a protected bay) and Worli (a site exposed to wave action). This suggests that cuttlefish prefer to lay their eggs in protected areas irrespective of the octocoral species. The presence of cuttlefish eggs on octocorals and absence on other possible structures highlights the ecological importance of octocorals, the necessity of proactive conservation measures, and comprehensive studies to protect this crucial intertidal habitat in urban coastlines. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.;2021;2023-07-04 07:32:57;2024-01-17 08:31:48;;115-121;;1;85;;Symbiosis;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"biodiversity; Alcyonacea; reef; conservation planning; Octocorals; marine ecosystem; Anthozoa; Habitat formation; Indian Ocean; Cuttlefish; Spawning; habitat conservation; nursery ground; India; Cephalopoda; Maharashtra; Menella; Mumbai; Pseudopterogorgia; Sepiella inermis; Sepiidae; spawning ground; CORAL-REEFS; HABITAT; IDENTIFICATION; INDIA; MUMBAI; ORBIGNY; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The reef-forming worm, Sabellaria alveolata (L. 1767) is currently classed as ‘Data Deficient’ due to an imbalance in the spread of data on its distribution. Little is known about the distribution of this species around Ireland. Using data archaeology, we collated past and present distribution records and discovered that S. alveolata has a discontinuous distribution with large gaps between populations. Many regions lack data and should be targeted for sampling. Biodiversity surveys revealed that S. alveolata supported diverse epibiotic algal communities. Retrograding (declining) reefs supported greater infaunal diversity than prograding (growing) reefs or sand, suggesting that S. alveolata is a dynamic ecosystem engineer that has a lasting legacy effect. Similar research should be carried out for other Data Deficient species, habitats and regions. Such data are invaluable resources for management and conservation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd;2021;2023-07-04 07:32:59;2024-01-17 08:54:58;;;;;169;;Mar. Environ.

Recent research indicates that benthic mats formed by the fleshy red alga Phyllophora crispa are also associated with high species richness. Among key groups found in these mats are sessile polychaetes, which live as epiphytes on the red algae thalli. Knowledge of abundance, species richness, and spatial variation of polychaetes associated with these habitats is still scarce. We carried out a comparative assessment focusing on serpulid polychaetes within samples from P. crispa mats and neighboring P. oceanica meadows at six different sampling sites around Giglio Island (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy). A total of 17 serpulid taxa were identified. The abundance of serpulids (5665 individuals m−2 of P. crispa mat) were similar to neighboring P. oceanica meadows (2304 individuals m−2 leaves and 5890 individuals m−2 shoots). The number of serpulid taxa was significantly higher in P. crispa mats (average 6.63 ± 1.32 taxa) compared to P. oceanica beds (average 1.56 ± 0.63 and 1.84 ± 1.04 taxa in leaves and shoots, respectively). Within habitat type, there were no significant differences in species richness between sites. The most abundant species found was Josephella marenzelleri (61% of individuals), while Vermiliopsis spp. and Bathyvermilia sp. were exclusively found in P. crispa samples. Our results highlight that P. crispa mats host an exceptional diversity and that these habitats should be included in conservation strategies. Further research should focus on the significance of other important taxonomic groups within these mats and evaluate the distribution of P. crispa in different regions of the Mediterranean Sea. © 2021 by the authors.

Few studies have explored the spatiotemporal distribution of H. stipulacea throughout the Caribbean and whether native invertebrates utilize this non-native seagrass as habitat. We surveyed the shallow, nearshore subtidal zones of four bays in St. John, US Virgin Islands over a two-year period to assess the abundance of both H. stipulacea and native seagrass species. We then surveyed macroinvertebrate communities in one bay with large areas of H. stipulacea, native seagrasses, and bare substrate to assess how macroinvertebrate species composition varied in these habitats. Our survey of the benthic macroinvertebrates revealed that: (1) native invertebrate species utilize H. stipulacea beds and (2) the density and richness of invertebrates was significantly higher in H. stipulacea beds compared to both native seagrass beds and bare substrate. Our results show that H. stipulacea is a common component of nearshore communities in St. John, USVI and that native invertebrates use H. stipulacea beds as habitat — results that agree with findings from other recent studies. While these findings indicate that native macroinvertebrate species can be abundant in non-native seagrass, further investigation, including experimental manipulations, preference tests, and surveys across broad spatial scales, are required to develop a robust understanding of the ecological impacts of this non-native grass. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.;2021;2023-07-04 07:33:00;2024-01-15 09:12:18;;;;;175;;Aquatic Bot.;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Seagrass; Community structure; Foundation species; seagrass; benthos; abundance; Halophila stipulacea; Caribbean; Macroinvertebrates; Non-native species; macroinvertebrate; bay; substrate; ecological impact; Indian Ocean; native species; Invertebrata; nearshore dynamics; Saint John [Virgin Islands (US)]; DIVERSITY; HABITAT; EXPANSION; RESTORATION; STRESS; INVASION; HALOPHILA-STIPULACEA; TAMARIX; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the case of ocean acidification (OA), submerged marine macrophytes, such as seagrasses, may create local areas of elevated pH due to their capacity to sequester dissolved inorganic carbon through photosynthesis. However, although seagrasses may increase seawater pH during the day, they can also decrease pH at night due to respiration. Therefore, it remains unclear how consequences of such diel fluctuations may unfold for organisms vulnerable to OA. We established mesocosms containing different levels of seagrass biomass (Zostera marina) to create a gradient of carbonate chemistry conditions and explored consequences for growth of juvenile and adult oysters (Crassostrea gigas), a non-native species widely used in aquaculture that can co-occur, and is often grown, in proximity to seagrass beds. In particular, we investigated whether increased diel fluctuations in pH due to seagrass metabolism affected oyster growth. Seagrasses increased daytime pH up to 0.4 units but had little effect on nighttime pH (reductions less than 0.02 units). Thus, both the average pH and the amplitude of diel pH fluctuations increased with greater seagrass biomass. The highest seagrass biomass increased oyster shell growth rate (mm day−1) up to 40%. Oyster somatic tissue weight and oyster condition index exhibited a different pattern, peaking at intermediate levels of seagrass biomass. This work demonstrates the ability of seagrasses to facilitate oyster calcification and illustrates how non-trophic metabolic interactions can modulate effects of environmental change. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;2021;2023-07-04 07:33:01;2024-01-15 10:28:34;;565-576;;2;196;;Oecologia;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Animals; seagrass; shell; Crassostrea gigas; environmental stress; ocean acidification; Zostera marina; biomass; Zosteraceae; respiration; vulnerability; carbon sequestration; carbon dioxide; Ocean acidification; Crassostrea; Climate refugia; carbonate; pH; Carbonates; animal; sea water; Seawater; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Carbon Dioxide; Ostreidae; carbonic acid; CO2; PH; BIODIVERSITY; WATER; CALCIFICATION; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; dissolved inorganic carbon; EELGRASS; ZOSTERA-MARINA; SEAWATER; RATES; Facilitative interaction; Marine macrophytes; Non-trophic interaction; diel variation; discu; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

During the last decade, Cystoseira forests have retracted their range considerably due to many interacting environmental, biological and anthropogenic pressures. We investigated how reducing in patch-size of C. montagnei affects their associated molluscan communities at the shallow northwest rocky shores of Palermo (Sicily, Italy). Molluscs were sampled from the fronds of individual thalli, clumps of 3 and 5 thalli of C. montagnei over an annual vegetative cycle (May–September) in two sites within the Marine Protected Area “Capo Gallo-Isola delle Femmine”. We measured five substrate attributes of the alga (thallus volume, canopy volume, interstitial volume, algal surface, and biomass) and explored their relationships with the diversity of the associated molluscan assemblage. A total of 3756 individuals of molluscs were collected, belonging to 30 families and 57 species, being Rissoidae the most speciose family and Barleeidae the dominant in terms of abundance. The molluscan assemblage on C. montagnei displayed significant spatial and seasonal variations, with the maximum number of individuals and species in summer, whereas evenness and diversity displayed maximum values in spring. The abundance, species richness and diversity of the molluscan assemblage decreased with decreasing in patch-size of C. montagnei, regardless of the vegetative phase of the alga or the sites considered in the study, while evenness showed an opposite trend. The substrate attributes of C. montagnei changed over the vegetative cycle of the alga and showed a similar pattern across sites with values that tended to decrease in autumn during the quiescence phase of the alga. Variation in patch-size of C. montagnei affected also the substrate attributes of the individual alga, with individual thalli becoming smaller with increasing patch-size. The algal surface of a single thallus of C. montagnei ranged on average from 956 cm2 in spring to 289 cm2 in autumn. Furthermore, algal surface together with thallus volume and dry weight were the substrate attributes that explained better the variation of the number of molluscan individuals and species. Overall, our results suggest that the reduction of both patch-size and algal substrate of C. montagnei forests altered the structure and composition of its associated molluscan assemblage. We argue that a reduction or loss of Cystoseira forests could probably trigger bottom-up effects in rocky shores habitats, with consequences for the whole ecosystem structure, functioning and services provided to humans. © 2020;2021;2023-07-04 07:33:07;2024-01-15 10:54:32;;;;;250;;Estuar.

Sponges are the dominant components of benthic communities in the Levant Sea; and especially in the recently discovered mesophotic sponge grounds off the coast of Israel. However, almost no data exist regarding their associated macrofauna. The current study sought to identify the macrofauna associated with massive sponges along the Israeli Mediterranean coast; and to compare the role of sponges, as ecosystem engineers, or “living hotels,” in both the shallow-water and mesophotic habitats. Sixty-four massive sponge specimens, from 10 different species, were collected from shallow and mesophotic habitats by SCUBA diving and Remotely Operated Vehicle, respectively. Sponge volume was estimated, specimens were dissected, and the associated macrofauna were identified. Our results reveal that the sponges supported a diverse assemblage of associated macrofauna. A total of 61 associated taxa were found, including species reported for the first time in Israel. A clear, differentiation existed in the structure of the associated assemblage between the two habitats, which is mainly attributed to four species (two polychaetes, a crustacean, and a brittle star). The trophic composition remained stable across the two habitats. No correlation was found between sponge volume and the associated fauna community parameters. The highest richness of associated fauna was found in the mesophotic habitat, where sponge diversity is also higher. In contrast, a greater endobiont abundance and density were recorded in the shallow habitat, where massive sponges may be a limiting factor due to their lower richness and abundance. Our findings emphasize the importance of sponges as ecosystem engineers, and suggest that sponge diversity may be an important factor that contribute to benthic biodiversity in these regions. © Copyright © 2021 Goren, Idan, Shefer and Ilan.";2020;2023-07-04 07:33:10;2024-01-22 08:37:46;;;;;7;;Front.

However, whether the habitat role of seagrasses is influenced by seagrass diversity, by dominant species or both, remains unclear. To that end, we sought to investigate the specific seagrass characteristics (e.g., species diversity, seagrass traits) that influence tropical fish assemblages, and place this in the context of small-scale fishery use. We surveyed seagrass variables at 55 plots, nested within 12 sites around Zanzibar (Tanzania) in the Western Indian Ocean, and used Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) systems to assess fish assemblages across plots. Using linear mixed models, we reveal that seagrass structural complexity and depth were the best predictors of fish abundance, with higher abundance occurring in deeper meadows or meadows with high canopy, leaf length and number of leaves per shoot. Moreover, an interaction between seagrass cover and land-use was the best predictor of fish species richness, where sites closer to human impacts were less affected by cover than sites with lower human impact. Overall, models with seagrass species richness or functional diversity as predictors poorly explained fish assemblages. Fish taxa that were important for small-scale fishery sectors (e.g., emperors, snappers, rabbitfish, and parrotfish) were primarily driven by seagrass structural complexity. Our results provide a unique analysis of the relationship between seagrass habitat and its associated fish assemblages in that we show that seagrass species diversity had little effect on seagrass fish assemblages, which instead appear driven by specific seagrass traits and seagrass cover. If conserving high value species that support adjacent fisheries is the priority for protecting seagrass meadows, then seagrass areas should be chosen with high cover and structural complexity that are in deeper waters. Any conservation measures also need to balance the needs of fishers that use the resources supported by seagrasses. © Copyright © 2021 Jones, Nordlund, Unsworth, Jiddawi and Eklöf.;2021;2023-07-04 07:33:11;2024-01-17 08:27:02;;;;;8;;Front.

However, although these ecosystem engineers have a facilitating role for some species, they may exclude or compete with others. The honeycomb worm Sabellaria alveolata (Linnaeus, 1767) is an important foundation species, commonly found from northwest Ireland to northern Mauritania, whose reef structures increase the physical complexity of the marine benthos, supporting high levels of biodiversity. Local patterns and regional differences in taxonomic and functional diversity were examined in honeycomb worm reefs from 10 sites along the northeastern Atlantic to explore variation in diversity across biogeographic regions and the potential effects of environmental drivers. While taxonomic composition varied across the study sites, levels of diversity remained relatively constant along the European coast. Assemblages showed high levels of species turnover compared to differences in richness, which varied primarily in response to sea surface temperatures and sediment content, the latter suggesting that local characteristics of the reef had a greater effect on community composition than the density of the engineering species. In contrast, the functional composition of assemblages was similar regardless of taxonomic composition or biogeography, with five functional groups being observed in all sites and only small differences in abundance in these groups being detected. Functional groups represented primarily filter-feeders and deposit-feeders, with the notable absence of herbivores, indicating that the reefs may act as biological filters for some species from the local pool of organisms. Redundancy was observed within functional groups that may indicate that honeycomb worm reefs can offer similar niche properties to its associated assemblages across varying environmental conditions. These results highlight the advantages of comparing taxonomic and functional metrics, which allow identification of a number of ecological processes that structure marine communities. © Copyright © 2021 Muller, Poitrimol, Nunes, Boyé, Curd, Desroy, Firth, Bush, Davies, Lima, Marzloff, Meneghesso, Seabra and Dubois.;2021;2023-07-04 07:33:17;2024-01-15 10:36:11;;;;;8;;Front.

Gorgonians, in particular, can form dense underwater forests that give shelter to other species increasing local biodiversity. In the last decades, several Mediterranean gorgonian populations have been affected by natural and anthropogenic impacts which drastically reduced their size. However, some species showed unexpected resilience, mainly due to the supply of new individuals. To understand the mechanisms underlying recovery processes, studies on the first life history stages (i.e. larval dispersal, settlement and recruitment) are needed. In tropical coral reefs, crustose coralline algae (CCA) are known to influence coral larvae habitat selection and settlement. This capacity however is not ubiquitous among CCA species and larvae of different coral species may have different preferences. The present work focuses on three Mediterranean gorgonians (Eunicella singularis, Paramuricea clavata and Corallium rubrum) with the objective of quantifying settlement and recruitment in presence of two common CCA species (Litophyllum stictaeforme and Litophyllum incrustans). Results showed that the presence of CCA activates earlier settlement in E. singularis and increases the density of recruits, with different trends for the three species. Our results suggest that CCA should be taken into account in the implementation of conservation strategies. Moreover, a deeper comprehension of settlement mechanisms could help improving restoration techniques based on sexual reproduction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.;2020;2023-07-04 07:33:22;2024-01-17 09:00:51;;;;;530-531;;J.

In the Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon (37° 40′S, 57° 23°W), the invasive reef-building polychaete Ficopomatus enigmaticus (Fauvel, 1823) generates a heterogeneous environment with habitats of variable complexity: the reefs themselves (high complexity), the sediment surrounding the reefs (low complexity), and the substrate from the areas without reefs (intermediate complexity). Our objective was to compare the macrofaunal assemblages along the whole complexity gradient. We hypothesized that individuals' abundance, diversity, species richness, and evenness of the macrofaunal assemblages increase with habitat complexity, since more complex habitats may represent greater availability of suitable spaces. The composition of the species assemblage was compared through monthly field samplings in each of the three habitats. Results showed that individuals' abundance increased with habitat complexity. In addition, amphipods were the most abundant group in the reefs, while ostracods were the most abundant group in the sediment surrounding the reefs and that from reef-free areas. However, community parameters were occasionally similar between the reefs and the sediment from reef-free areas, depending on the month considered. Our study suggests that the invasion of F. enigmaticus changed the macrofaunal assemblages and the individuals' abundances by providing a high complexity substrate, but also, and less predictably, by increasing habitat heterogeneity, highlighting the importance of including both dimensions of habitat structure in the study of invasions by ecosystem engineers. © 2020;2020;2023-07-04 07:33:23;2024-01-18 08:29:53;;;;;246;;Estuar.

In the marine environment, small crustaceans and other mobile invertebrates (‘epifauna') represent a basal component in reef food webs, with a pivotal secondary production role that is strongly influenced by their body size-distribution. Ongoing degradation of reef habitats that affect invertebrate size-distributions, particularly transformation of coral and kelp habitat to algal turf, may thus fundamentally affect secondary production. Here we explored variation in size spectra of shallow epifaunal assemblages (i.e. the slope and intercept of the linear relationship between log abundance and body size at the assemblage level) across 21 reef microhabitats distributed along an extensive eastern Australian climatic gradient from the tropical northern Great Barrier Reef to cool temperate Tasmania. When aggregated across microhabitats at the site scale, invertebrate body size spectra (0.125–8 mm range) were consistently log-linear (R2 ranging 0.87–0.98). Size spectra differed between, but not within, major groups of microhabitats, and exhibited little variability between tropical and temperate biomes. Nevertheless, size spectra showed significant tropical/temperate differences in slopes for epifauna sampled on macroalgal habitats, and in elevation for soft coral and sponge habitats. Our results reveal epifaunal size spectra to be a highly predictable macro-ecological feature. Given that variation in epifaunal size spectra among groups of microhabitats was greater than variation between tropical and temperate biomes, we postulate that ocean warming will not greatly alter epifaunal size spectra directly. However, transformation of tropical coral and temperate macroalgal habitats to algal turfs due to warming will alter reef food web dynamics through redistribution of the size of prey available to fishes. © 2020 Nordic Society Oikos.

Yet, the mechanisms that enable many of these invaders to thrive and alter their newly invaded habitats are still not fully understood. This applies to habitats such as widespread sedimentary shorelines characterized by the presence of scattered biogenic clumps of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) structurally more complex than bare sediments. In Atlantic Canada, some of these shorelines are numerically dominated by native mud crabs (Dyspanopeus sayi) but have been gradually invaded by the European green crab (Carcinus maenas). This study describes between-habitat (mussel clump vs. bare sediment) differences in density and diversity of invertebrates. It also tests the impact of juvenile green crabs in comparison to native mud crabs using two approaches: First, measuring habitat-related differences in these crabs' feeding rates on a common prey (soft-shell clams, Mya arenaria). Second, measuring their influence on invertebrate communities associated with mussel clumps. The results show that mussel clumps hold higher invertebrate density and diversity than surrounding sedimentary bottoms. In the laboratory, the feeding rates of native mud crabs were dependent on the type of habitat (sand flat > mussel clump), whereas those of green crabs were significantly higher and unrelated to the habitat in which predation occurred. In field experiments, juvenile green crabs were also the only predators that changed community structure in the mussel clump habitat. These results indicate that green crabs can cause a significant impact on native species and communities. Moreover, they suggest that the ability of this species to overcome the refuge provided by complex biogenic habitats for prey may represent an unexplored mechanism to explain this invader's expansion here and elsewhere. © 2020 Malyshev et al.

Results indicated patterns of unchanging faunal metrics across seagrass types (abundance, richness, diversity, evenness, taxonomic distinctness, and patchiness) but variation in relative proportions of dominant taxa, particularly microgastropods (abundant in Zostera, insignificant in Cymodocea and Halodule). Although assemblage composition varied, faunal dissimilarities (except with Zostera) were very low and of similar magnitudes within and between different 'host' seagrasses. This suggests that such macroecological faunal characteristics are not consequent on the precise local ecosystem engineer but largely reflect those of a common pool of locally available species, so that the differences in animal abundance and biodiversity described in some studies relate not directly to features inherent in the different seagrasses, but to associated habitat variables. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;2020;2023-07-04 07:33:29;2024-01-22 09:17:32;;;;;160;;Mar.

Although a large body of evidence exists regarding macroalgal canopies on intertidal rocky shores, little is known regarding attached perennial species in soft sediment environments. The aim of this study was to assess whether the presence of an Ascophyllum nodosum canopy altered physical parameters, leading to the formation of different environmental conditions in the areas around the canopy and whether this led to changes in the local community. Sediment cores were taken in canopy-present and canopy-absent treatments at four sites over four sampling periods covering winter (November and January) through to spring (March and May) to assess modification of seven physical parameters: particle size, sand/silt/clay content, chlorophyll a, organic carbon, pore water content and temperature, as well as for macrofaunal diversity. Results revealed significant differences between treatments for all variables with the exception of clay content. Areas below the canopy were dominated by a high abundance of opportunistic species indicating a more disturbed environment, with increased levels of organic enrichment, anoxia and scouring found to be the principal sources of physical disturbance. In conclusion, differences in abiotic parameters between canopy and non-canopy areas in soft-sediment environments were driven both directly and indirectly by the presence of the algal canopy. This facilitated an alternative community composition that enhanced biodiversity within algal-sediment shores. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;2020;2023-07-04 07:33:34;2024-01-22 08:45:40;;;;;162;;Mar. Environ.

The marine fan worm, Sabella spallanzanii, is an ecosystem engineering NIS that forms dense filter-feeding canopies on hard substrata and large clumps of individuals in soft sediment habitats. In this study, we investigated the epifaunal assemblages associated with Sabella clumps of increasing size and complexity from soft-sediment benthic ecosystems in Auckland Harbour, New Zealand. The diversity and abundance of epifaunal taxa increased with clump size. Species accumulation curves suggest that with further increases in Sabella clump size, diversity will continue to increase. There were no differential effects on taxa related to feeding mode or motility despite the potential for Sabella to reduce food to suspension feeders (through competition) and increase food supply to deposit feeders (through biodeposition). Our results provide an example of local biodiversity enhancement by an NIS, though some of the species benefitting from Sabella were themselves non-indigenous or of uncertain origin (cryptogenic/indeterminate). Longer term studies of the impacts of Sabella on native biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including on food webs, are important next steps. © 2020 by the authors.;2020;2023-07-04 07:33:36;2024-01-22 09:00:07;;;;6;12;;Diversity;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Biodiversity; ecosystem engineering; epifauna; habitat structure; ecosystem engineer; biodiversity; benthos; Ecosystem engineer; abundance; Non-indigenous species; Epifauna; biological invasion; polychaete; Atrina zelandica; New Zealand; biogenic structure; species diversity; non-indigenous species; Sabella spallanzanii; marine ecosystem; seafloor; filter feeding; North Island; Auckland [North Island]; Biogenic structure; Marine soft-sediment; Sabella; Species accumulation curve; COMMUNITIES; IMPACTS; ABUNDANCE; COMPETITION; FACILITATION; HABITAT COMPLEXITY; ATRINA-ZELANDICA; PORT-PHILLIP BAY; INTRODUCED POLYCHAETE; SUSPENSION-FEEDING BIVALVE; marine soft-sediment; species accumulation curve; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Despite their critical importance, the role of foundation species in stabilizing natural communities has seldom been quantified. In theory, the stability of a foundation species should promote community stability by enhancing species richness, altering the population fluctuations of individual species, or both. Here we tested the hypothesis that the stability of a marine foundation species, the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, increased the stability of the aggregate biomass of a phylogenetically diverse assemblage of understory algae and sessile invertebrates that compete for space beneath the giant kelp canopy. To achieve this goal, we analyzed an 18-yr time series of the biomass of giant kelp and its associated benthic community collected from 32 plots distributed among nine shallow reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel, USA. We showed that the stability of understory algae and sessile invertebrates was positively and indirectly related to the stability of giant kelp, which primarily resulted from giant kelp's direct positive association with species richness. The stability of all community types was positively related to species richness via increased species stability and species asynchrony. The stabilizing effects of richness were three to four times stronger when algae and invertebrates were considered separately rather than in combination. Our finding that diversity–stability relationships were stronger in communities consisting of species with similar resource requirements suggests that competition for shared resources rather than differential responses to environmental conditions played a more important role in stabilizing the community. Increasing threats to structure-forming foundation species worldwide necessitates a detailed understanding of how they influence their associated community. This study is among the first to show that dampened temporal fluctuations in the biomass of a foundation species is an important determinant of the stability of the complex communities it supports. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America;2020;2023-07-04 07:33:37;2024-07-16 07:48:05;;;;5;101;;Ecology;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Animals; Ecosystem; Kelp; foundation species; kelp forest; Invertebrates; biodiversity; species richness; benthos; ecosystem; algae; kelp; Macrocystis pyrifera; community structure; forest; United States; kelp forests; invertebrate; California; understory; Macrocystis; Santa Barbara Channel; environmental conditions; animal; Forests; time series analysis; native species; phylogenetics; Invertebrata; PATTERNS; BIODIVERSITY; CONSEQUENCES; VARIABILITY; RECRUITMENT; FACILITATION; PRODUCTIVITY; community stability; ECOSYSTEM STABILITY; TEMPORAL STABILITY; COMPENSATORY DYNAMICS; diversity-stability relationship; environmental heterogeneity; species asynchrony; diversity–stability relationship; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The intertidal seaweed Hormosira banksii (H. banksii) is an abundant species and important ecosystem engineer on rocky shores and estuaries in south-east Australia, where it creates thick canopies colonized by a range of invertebrates, particularly gastropods. In Tasmania (southern Australia), H. banksii shows large variability in thallus length and structure, with different algal morphologies on coasts and in estuaries. In this study, individuals of two gastropod species were sampled from different habitats (north coast, east coast and northern estuaries) to: (1) describe the spatial variability in their abundance and shell morphology, and (2) understand if any relationship exists between H. banksii morphology and gastropod shell morphology. Gastropod abundance and morphology were variable, but multivariate analysis suggested a marginal influence of H. banksii morphological traits, particularly vesicle size, on the patterns observed. As the two gastropod species use habitat differently and that different H. banksii morphs occur in different locations, our results suggest that both algal morphology and environmental conditions may affect gastropod abundance and shell morphology across the different habitats. Hence, from these results a model can be developed and tested in subsequent experimental work to tease apart the effects of seaweed morphology from environmental conditions. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.;2020;2023-07-04 07:33:40;2024-04-17 14:24:03;;653-670;;2;54;;Aquatic Ecol.;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"morphology; seaweed; spatial analysis; shell; Ecosystem engineer; abundance; algae; Morphology; multivariate analysis; Seaweed; intertidal environment; Tasmania; Australia; Gastropod; gastropod; Hormosira banksii; Gastropoda; environmental conditions; Invertebrata; experimental study; eggshell; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; CORALLINE ALGAE; HABITAT SELECTION; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; WAVE ACTION; FRACTAL DIMENSIONS; ROCKY; HORMOSIRA-BANKSII FUCALES; LITTORINA; PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We studied the case of two ecosystem engineers: a non-native ascidian, Pyura praeputialis, and the native mussel, Perumytilus purpuratus, in the rocky shores of Antofagasta Bay, northern Chile. P. praeputialis was once dominant in mid- and low-intertidal zones, but human harvesting has severely reduced the extent of the P. praeputialis band, allowing for competition from P. purpuratus, which subsequently expanded and replaced P. praeputialis. We compared the macrobenthic community structure between these two ecosystem engineers at five sites throughout the bay. Our results suggest not only an important share of species composition between the ecosystem engineers (68.1%) but also dissimilarity due to differential changes in taxa abundance. Taxonomic richness and diversity were always high in both ecosystem engineers when analyzing communities in areas without these engineers. Diversity recorded in P. praeputialis was slightly higher than those in P. purpuratus; however, the re-establishment of the native mussel could prevent a substantial drop in diversity as the invasive bioengineer disappears. From a biogeographical standpoint, all recorded taxa associated with both ecosystem engineers were native, thus allowing us to conclude that P. praeputialis did not further facilitate the presence of invasive species; rather, this bioengineer could be considered a reservoir of native fauna. Our study highlights the importance of the coexistence of multiple ecosystems engineers and their interactions in the maintenance of biodiversity in rocky shores, especially in cases where human disturbance reduces the more dominant but invasive ecosystem engineer. © 2020, Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung.";2020;2023-07-04 07:33:43;2024-01-17 10:09:31;;;;1;50;;Mar.

Our goal was to determine whether Ribbed Mussels increase the abundance and diversity of the nekton assemblage at high tide. We sampled an area of marsh in Charleston, SC, using drop-net traps to compare nekton abundance, species richness, species diversity, and species composition in plots with and without Ribbed Mussels. Over the course of 1 year, there were no significant differences between plots with and without mussels in any of the metrics of nekton abundance or diversity, although ordination results suggested that the species composition was distinct in each plot type. Season and tidal height were more important in influencing nekton assemblage abundance and diversity. Our findings suggest that the Ribbed Mussel does not act as a foundation species for nekton at the patch scale, although it does influence the composition of the nekton assemblage, as do season and tidal height. The role of the Ribbed Mussel as a foundation species for the nekton assemblage at the landscape scale remains untested. © 2020 Humboldt Field Research Institute.

There is little information available regarding the status of natural OR in China. This study examined the seasonal and temporal changes in the Kumamoto oyster Crassostrea sikamea population and associated benthic macrofaunal communities at the largest intertidal OR (Liyashan) of the China Sea in four field surveys (spring and fall in 2013 and 2018). The oyster densities exhibited no evident seasonal variations in either 2013 or 2018 but showed significant temporal changes and declined by 89.66% in spring and 96.27% in fall between 2013 and 2018. The total densities of benthic macrofaunal communities at the reef area of the OR were significantly higher than those at the degraded oyster habitat (DOH) and dramatically decreased by 80.73% in spring and 64.87% in fall between 2013 and 2018. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination indicated the benthic macrofaunal communities differed significantly between the OR and DOH or among the four sampling periods. Analysis of similarity indicated that the benthic communities at the OR had greater seasonal and temporal changes than did those at the DOH, and that temporal changes in benthic communities were greater than seasonal changes at each habitat. The study concluded that the OR had decreased habitat values as the oyster populations and the benthic macrofaunal communities dramatically declined from 2013 to 2018. © 2020 National Shellfisheries Association.

Farming damselfishes cultivate and aggressively protect algal garden within their territory, thereby shaping local fish assemblages and macro-algae diversity. Following the widespread loss of live branching coral throughout Florida and the Caribbean Sea, dusky damselfish (Stegastes adustus) have modified their territorial behavior. We compared antagonistic behavior, and size and algal species composition of territories of dusky damselfish on dead branching coral rubble and live boulder coral in the Dry Tortugas National Park, USA. Even though similar numbers of “intruders” entered each habitat type, dusky damselfish on rubble territories chased out significantly more fishes, had larger territories and more species of algae were present in their gardens. This study shows that dusky damselfish successfully occupy living and dead coral areas; however, there are potential trade-offs between defending a larger territory and cultivating fewer algal species. © 2020, The Author(s).";2020;2023-07-04 07:33:45;2024-01-22 09:04:15;;;;8;167;;Mar.

Sampling of M. palmata was conducted biweekly during the reproductive period in F. enigmaticus reefs and sediment from reef-free areas, accounting for the vertical distribution and the presence/absence of macroalgae. Males, females (non-ovigerous and ovigerous), and juveniles are present in both reefs and sediment, but the abundance of M. palmata is several orders of magnitude higher in reefs. Reefs’ M. palmata population (demo) displays variations in: (a) abundance, (b) mean size, and (c) proportions of demographic categories. In reefs, females show a higher proportion of ovigerous specimens and a female-biased sex ratio, contrasting the 1:1 ratio observed in sediment. Individuals are more abundant in the surface layer covered with macroalgae in reefs (small sizes) and macroalgae or valves in sediment. The association of M. palmata to F. enigmaticus reefs drives its permanency in the system, enhancing its reproductive potential via different reproductive traits and habitat use, with a reduced potential to spread to marginal areas. © 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH;2020;2023-07-04 07:33:46;2024-01-22 09:11:00;;1-21;;3;41;;Mar.

The effects of these co-occurring ecosystem engineers may act simultaneously and vary independently depending on ambient environmental conditions they modify. Using a saltmarsh ecosystem with continuing invasion of nonnative cordgrass and aggregation of native bivalve shells, we tested whether the ecosystem engineering effects of shell aggregation on macroinvertebrates depended on the plants due to their ability to trap shell debris. We found habitats covered with shell aggregation and vegetated cordgrass significantly increase the biodiversity but decrease the biomass of macroinvertebrates comparing to the tidal bare flats, whereas no differences were detected among shell covered, cordgrass vegetated and their coexistent habitats. Our study highlights the importance of considering multiple, potentially conflicting management goals, which may require flexibility and trade-offs to integrate nonnative and native resources into ecosystem management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;2020;2023-07-04 07:33:47;2024-01-17 09:04:10;;;;;152;;Mar.

The characteristics that mediate their value to associated organisms, however, are not always clear. Traditional assessments of habitat-former and associated community relationships use broad-scale classifications to group habitat-formers according to identity or gross morphology. Trait-based approaches instead measure traits at the level of the individual and in doing so allow for predictions that are not constrained to taxonomic groups. By measuring at the level of the individual, trait-based approaches have the potential to capture not only interspecific variability, but also the intraspecific variation that is often ignored by traditional approaches. Trait-based approaches may therefore provide a novel way to link the characteristics of habitat-formers to ecosystem functioning. Here we quantified inter- and intraspecific variation in six macroalgal species and tested the relative importance of morphological traits and species identity in predicting the abundance of associated fauna. All species of macroalgae displayed substantial intraspecific morphological variation. Morphological traits were more important than species identity in predicting epifaunal abundances. Total surface area was the most important trait when predicting total abundance per thallus, whilst mean frond length was the most important predictor for abundance per gram algal biomass. This suggests that traits that describe the quantity of available habitat were the most important predictors of community abundance, but the shape or architecture of the habitat also contributes to structuring these communities. Our results indicate that trait-based approaches may be more useful than traditional species-based approaches when predicting the abundances of fauna associated with habitat-forming species.

We aimed to understand how relationships between the physical characteristics of macroalgal habitats and their invertebrate communities varied across spatial scales and whether general ecological patterns occurred across two countries. Location: Eighteen sites across the temperate east coasts of Australia (over 1,300 km) and New Zealand (over 1,000 km), with the latitudinal gradient in the two countries overlapping by 6.73 decimal degrees. Time period: January to early April 2012. Major taxa studied: Three intertidal macroalgal habitats in each country and the invertebrate communities within them. Methods: We measured variation in patch- and individual-level characteristics of macroalgal habitats and their invertebrate communities. Patterns in macroalgal characteristics and communities were compared across latitude, and at smaller spatial scales, and correlated with 26 abiotic environmental variables using multiple multivariate analyses. Results: Separately, macroalgal habitat characteristics and communities showed unusual but consistent nonlinear latitudinal patterns, with greater similarity among sites at the edges of the sampled distribution (i.e., north and south) than at centrally located sites. Macroalgal characteristics did not correlate with a particular set of environmental variables; however, communities were structured by sea surface temperature at the country scale and by macroalgal habitat type and biomass within countries. Anthropogenic variables were also important and may have contributed to the unusual nonlinear patterns observed between macroalgal characteristics and communities across latitude. Main conclusions: Our results support other studies showing that large-scale patterns can emerge from systems where there is high local-scale variability. The results show that communities within macroalgal habitats respond to both the physical characteristics of the habitat and external environmental conditions (e.g., temperature), suggesting that local-scale environmental factors, including anthropogenic stressors, may modulate environmental gradients over larger scales. © 2020 The Authors.

However, the nature of the impact of invasive macroalgae on native mobile invertebrate assemblage is still hard to predict. In this sense, the degree of morphological resemblance (mainly structural complexity) between native and exotic habitat-forming species has been proposed as a suitable predictor of epifauna response to biological invasions. The recently introduced macroalga Rugulopteryx okamurae is becoming a dominant element in coastal rocky bottoms in the Strait of Gibraltar, where it is sympatric with the native species Dictyota dichotoma. Despite the high morphological similarity between both habitat-forming species, native and exotic macroalgae hosted different macrofaunal assemblages. Dictyota dichotoma showed lower number of species, abundance of individuals, and diversity values than the introduced macroalga. Most shared species showed higher abundance on R. okamurae, but there was high variability in the response to macroalgal identity across higher taxa. Thus, there were no major differences in polychaete assemblage between macroalgal species or among sites, when considering univariate measures (abundance of individuals, number of species and H′ values) or species composition (with the exception of abundance values), while peracarid crustaceans and molluscs showed the opposite pattern. Therefore, our results suggest that morphological similarities among habitat-forming species do not always allow predicting of whether the invasive taxa are functionally equivalent to native ones. They also highlight the relevance of fine taxonomical resolution for revealing complex impacts of invasive macroalgae. In addition, R. okamurae’s capacity to determine significant changes on native fauna has been pointed out. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;2019;2023-07-04 07:33:56;2024-01-22 15:50:15;;3319-3334;;11;21;;Biol.

We deployed an array of 28 artificial reefs with transplanted Ecklonia radiata, the dominant canopy-forming kelp species across southern Australia, to investigate how the patch size and density of E. radiata influenced the establishment of the associated communities of plants and animals. Many of the reefs were rapidly colonized by Ostrea angasi, a critically depleted reef-forming oyster. Over the 24-month deployment of the reefs, thick oyster mats formed across the entire surface of many of the reefs with estimated biomass densities exceeding 5 kg of live oysters/m2; however, oyster density was dependent on E. radiata patch size and density. Increasing patch size and the presence of kelp resulted in significantly higher densities of oysters 5 months after the reefs were deployed and at the end of the experiment, where oysters were approximately three times more numerous on reefs with kelp compared to those without kelp. E. radiata appeared to facilitate the establishment of O. angasi largely through its capacity to reduce benthic light and thus suppress competition from turfing algae. These results may inform the development of novel approaches to tackle recruitment bottlenecks affecting the restoration of O. angasi reefs. © 2019 Society for Ecological Restoration";2019;2023-07-04 07:33:59;2024-01-22 15:22:10;;1442-1451;;6;27;;Restor.

Many studies have linked A. vermiculophyllum to positive effects on invertebrate communities, some even suggesting that it could restore function to degraded ecosystems. However, A. vermiculophyllum effects on native foundation species remain poorly understood, and its effects on infauna have received less attention than effects on epifauna. Here, we confirm that A. vermiculophyllum can increase infaunal diversity and abundance. However, during an unusually large “superbloom” of A. vermiculophyllum, we observed elevated mortality of Diopatra cuprea (Polychaeta: Onuphidae), a native foundation species. At the same time, historical data suggest that D. cuprea populations have generally declined in regions invaded by A. vermiculophyllum.

This impedes our capacity to predict biodiversity changes and how they affect ecosystem functioning at scales relevant for conservation. Here, we address the functional implications of ongoing seafloor changes by characterizing at regional scale the taxonomic and functional α and β diversities of benthic habitats currently threatened by biotic homogenization. Location: Western Europe. Methods: Combining a trait-based approach to benthic community monitoring data covering a 7-year period and 500 km of coast, we explored the mechanisms governing community assembly in habitats associated with two types of foundation species, intertidal seagrass and subtidal maerl beds, compared to bare sediment at similar tidal level. We assessed their spatial and temporal variability and linked these mechanisms to their repercussions at regional scale through analyses of taxonomic and functional β diversity. Results: Foundation species locally promote taxonomic and functional diversity. Maerl fine-scale heterogeneity promotes niche diversity and leads to high functional redundancy for the whole subtidal compartment, providing insurance for seafloor functioning. Seagrass high diversity seems more reliant on transient species and is associated with redundancy of only a few functions. Maintaining the seascapes in which seagrass are embedded seems essential to ensure their long-term functioning. At regional scale, the locally poorer bare sediment harbour similar functional richness as biogenic habitats because of higher within-habitat β diversity. Main conclusions: Our study reinforces the conservation value of biogenic habitats but highlights that different mechanisms underlie their local diversity, which has implications for the vulnerabilities of their associated communities. Accounting for β diversity at regional scale also stressed a potential underrated conservation value of bare sediment for benthic ecosystem functioning. Coupling trait-based approaches to monitoring data can help link broad-scale β diversity to its underlying drivers, bringing local mechanistic understanding closer to the scales at which biodiversity loss and management actions occur. © 2019 The Authors.

In temperate coastal waters, eutrophication and grazing have driven a global decline in native seaweeds and facilitated the establishment of nonnative seaweeds that provide novel macrophyte habitat. We tested whether a nonnative kelp canopy (wakame Undaria pinnatifida) functions as a viable habitat or ecological trap for several endemic reef fishes on urchin-grazed reefs in southern Australia. We assessed the willingness of fish to utilize native vs. wakame kelp canopy via a laboratory habitat choice experiment and by recording natural recruitment to specially constructed boulder reefs with manipulated kelp canopy. We also compared fish communities on natural reefs using a before-after-control-impact survey of wakame patches, and to assess the quality of wakame habitat for resident fish, compared fitness metrics for fish collected from habitats with native vs. wakame kelp canopy. Endemic fishes did not distinguish between the native or wakame canopy but preferred both to barren reef habitats. On urchin-grazed natural reefs, fish occurred in higher abundance and diversity where seasonal wakame canopy was present. Fitness metrics in fish collected from wakame patches were comparable to those in fish from adjacent native kelp patches. These findings indicate that the nonnative canopy provides a viable habitat for endemic fish and may play a role in sustaining native fauna populations in this degraded ecosystem. More broadly, we recommend that managers consider the role of nonnative habitats within the context of environmental change, as endemic fauna may benefit from nonnative habitat-formers in areas where their native counterparts cannot persist. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America;2019;2023-07-04 07:34:07;2024-01-24 13:20:18;;;;7;29;;Ecol.

Despite the fundamental importance of such gradients, there are many gaps in our understanding of how abiotic stress gradients interplay with biotic processes and how these collectively affect species distributions. Using a hierarchical design, we sampled two communities separated by depth along wave exposure and salinity gradients to elucidate how these two gradients affect species composition in habitats formed by the foundation species Mytilus trossulus and Fucus vesiculosus. Specifically, we looked at the impacts of regional salinity and temperature, local wave exposure, and site-dependent facilitation effects on the associated community composition. Wave exposure was the best predictor for species assembly structure, which was also affected by Mytilus biomass and by salinity and water temperature. While the tested variables provided robust explanations for community structure and density, they did not provide conclusive explanations for variation in species richness or evenness. Mytilus biomass had a stronger effect on the associated community with increasing wave exposure at the deeper depth, but the patterns were less obvious at the shallower depth. The latter was also the case for Fucus. These findings comply partly with theoretical predictions suggesting stronger facilitation effects in physically harsh environments. Our results indicate that environmental drivers are the main structuring forces that affect species assembly structure, but also foundation species are important. Thus, predicting changes in species distributions and biodiversity requires the simultaneous consideration of environmental gradients, as well as the structure and composition of foundation species and the interplay between these factors. This work advances our understanding of the processes that modulate species distributions in a marginal marine area and broadens the knowledge of how biological and environmental factors interplay and have an influence on hard-bottom community structure in brackish water seas. © 2019 The Authors.;2019;2023-07-04 07:34:12;2024-01-22 10:23:09;;;;10;10;;Ecosphere;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"facilitation; foundation species; community structure; environmental gradients; stress-gradient hypothesis; Baltic Sea; biodiversity patterns; scale dependency; DIVERSITY; DISTURBANCE; FUCUS-VESICULOSUS; BIODIVERSITY; EXPOSURE; COMPETITION; COMPLEXITY; MYTILUS-EDULIS; POPULATION; BLUE MUSSEL BEDS; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Using an array of 28 artificial reefs supporting transplants of a dominant canopy-forming kelp (Ecklonia radiata) representing 7 patch sizes (0.12-7.68 m2) crossed with 4 kelp densities (0-16 ind. m-2), we determined how differences in the patch size and density of this ecosystem engineer influenced the associated understorey assemblages, including the abundance of turf algae, foliose algae and sessile invertebrates. We then determined how abiotic and biotic factors modified by E. radiata related to the abundance of these functional groups and E. radiata recruitment. Decreasing patch size and absence of kelp led to the proliferation of turfs, whilst foliose algae and invertebrates were dominant on larger reefs with kelp, where intermediate densities of kelp supported the highest abundance of foliose algae. We postulate that benthic light was the most important factor positively influencing turf cover, which in turn suppressed foliose algae. Adverse effects of light and sediment deposition best explained the cover of invertebrates. Contrary to expectation, understorey species had little effect on the density of E. radiata recruits, which instead was strongly correlated with the abundance of transplanted kelp on each reef. These results highlight the capacity of E. radiata to influence major functional groups within the sub-canopy via abiotic ecosystem engineering and through control of turfs and indicate that the negative effect of understorey algae on kelp recruitment may be context specific. © Inter-Research 2019.;2019;2023-07-04 07:34:14;2024-01-22 15:13:20;;59-79;;;632;;Mar.

Intraspecific variation in individual properties of these strong facilitators can affect the whole suite of the dependent taxa. Marine macroalgae often act as ecosystem engineers, providing shelter and substrate for numerous associated organisms. Epibiosis of foliose red algae, however, remains underexplored, especially in the high latitudes. Here we studied sessile macrobenthic assemblages associated with a foliose red algae Phycodrys rubens in the White Sea (66° N) shallow subtidal, and the effect of individual plant properties on their structure. The blades of P. rubens develop annually, and it is possible to tell the young (usually larger) plant parts from the old ones. We hypothesized that epibenthic community structure depends on plant part age and size. We examined epibiosis on 110 plants at two sites, and the results generally supported our hypotheses. Old plant parts were several times smaller, and had higher total cover than young parts. Sponges strongly dominated the epibiosis on old parts, and young parts were dominated by polychaetes and bryozoans. Plant part surface area negatively correlated with total cover on young parts, while on old parts the relatioship was location-specific. On young parts the relative abundance of a polychaete Circeis armoricana increased with surface area, and the proportion of sponges decreased. The patterns indicate that epibenthic community structure is linked to the demography of an ecosystem engineer. © 2019 by the authors.;2019;2023-07-04 07:34:17;2024-01-24 10:46:57;;;;5;11;;Diversity;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"macroalgae; facilitation; ecosystem engineering; foundation species; intraspecific variation; Foundation species; ecosystem engineer; Ecosystem engineer; Epibiosis; Facilitation; Macroalgae; community structure; Arctic; White Sea; macrobenthos; epibiosis; Polychaeta; Bryozoa; Rhodophyta; sessile species; Arctic Ocean; size effect; MARINE; COMPETITION; RECRUITMENT; COMMUNITY; GROWTH-RATES; LARVAL SETTLEMENT; PATCH SIZE; REPRODUCTIVE PHENOLOGY; RHODOPHYTA; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; Circeis armoricana; Phycodrys rubens; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For the first time, rapid habitat dominance shifts and altered competitive replacement from a reef-forming to a non-reef-forming biogenic habitat were documented over one-year exposure to low pH/high CO                             2                              through a transplant experiment off Vulcano Island CO                             2                              seeps (NE Sicily, Italy). Ocean acidification decreased vermetid reefs complexity via a reduction in the reef-building species density, boosted canopy macroalgae and led to changes in composition, structure and functional diversity of the associated benthic assemblages. OA effects on invertebrate richness and abundance were nonlinear, being maximal at intermediate complexity levels of vermetid reefs and canopy forming algae.

We measured the relative importance of seaweeds in structuring the abundance, richness, and distribution of macroinvertebrates at three tidal levels on a rocky shore. Through manipulative experiments, we characterized temperature, irradiance, and desiccation underneath seaweed canopy plots made up of either Silvetia compressa or Stephanocystis dioica, assembled at three biomasses. We assessed differences in the abundance, richness, and the distribution of macroinvertebrates underneath the canopy as a function of seaweed species and biomass and evaluated differences due to the tidal height of the installed experimental seaweeds. We found that manipulated seaweed biomass significantly affected the community structure of associated macroinvertebrates at all tidal levels, especially at higher biomass treatments. Although contrary to other studies, we found no effect on richness underneath the canopies at any tidal height. Our results show that intertidal seaweeds provide protection from water loss, heat, and irradiance when compared to manipulative controls with no canopy cover. We also found that the relative importance of the experimental seaweed canopies in their ability to mitigate stressful abiotic conditions increased with prolonged emersion periods, such as at higher levels in the intertidal zone. At the higher tidal level tested, a greater abundance of macroinvertebrates was associated with the experimental canopies in comparison to the manipulation-control plots and the natural substrate. These results emphasize the role of intertidal seaweeds as bioengineers and highlight the importance of preserving and restoring high densities of leathery seaweeds on degraded shores in order to preserve the dynamics of the intertidal ecosystem overall. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;2019;2023-07-04 07:34:20;2024-07-16 09:34:17;;100-107;;;511;;J.

The study also investigated whether the erosion of parts of the reef by intense wave action results in differences in the fauna. Samples were collected from a patch of reef and the adjacent sandy sediment for the analysis of the zoobenthos and substrates (granulometry and organic matter content) on Algodoal-Maiandeua Island (northern Brazil coast). The reef had more heterogeneous sediments and a higher organic matter content, and its fauna was distinct from that of the beach, with a higher density, species richness and diversity. The reef fauna included taxa typical of both consolidated and unconsolidated substrates. The portion of the reef more exposed to wave action had a lower density of reef-building worms, and these worms were smaller in size than those of the more protected portion, although the associated fauna of the exposed portion was denser and richer in species. These results confirmed that S. wilsoni is an important ecosystem engineer on the Amazon coast, and that the diversity and unique features of the fauna associated with these reefs emphasize their importance as a substrate for the local benthic communities, in particular in areas where consolidated bottoms are naturally scarce. © Copyright Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom 2019.;2019;2023-07-04 07:34:21;2024-01-24 13:20:18;;1099-1109;;5;99;;J.

Climate change is shifting the distribution and magnitude of environmental gradients, making identification of when and where foundation species effects occur necessary for effective management. We reviewed existing work to identify expected mechanisms by which seagrass affect suspension feeding bivalves, then tested whether these effects shifted across estuarine conditions for two species of oysters (native Ostrea lurida and non-native Crassostrea gigas) grown in and out of eelgrass (Zostera marina) at six estuarine sites in Washington state. Hypothesized mechanisms of eelgrass influence include reduced predation pressure, reduced or altered food availability, and amelioration of environmental (pH) stress. We analyzed oyster survival, shell and tissue growth, shell strength, and stable isotope (SI) and fatty acid (FA) biomarkers. Oyster survival was > 20% lower in eelgrass at lower-estuary sites, but not up-estuary sites. Both species grew faster in eelgrass at one low-estuary (higher pH) site, but not elsewhere. Shell strength in eelgrass increased by 21.1% for native but decreased by 12.6% for non-native oysters. FA and SI biomarkers only differed in eelgrass at one site but correlated significantly to growth among individuals. No measurement showed a consistent response to eelgrass across estuarine conditions and taxa, and responses were often opposite of expectations based on published literature. These results have important implications for management and restoration of oysters in areas with eelgrass. © 2018, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.;2019;2023-07-04 07:34:22;2024-01-24 09:00:56;;743-754;;3;42;;Estuar.

We could demonstrate that the relative importance of this foundation species for its infaunal community increases with environmental variables associated with increasing hydrodynamic stress (depth, sand ripples formation, sediment grain size and organic content). Faunal assemblages in proximity to the Zostera patch edges, however, showed no (infauna) or negative (epifauna) response to hydrodynamic stress. Our study highlights that the facilitative outcome of a foundation species is conditional to the faunal assemblage in question and can be highly variable even between positions within the habitat. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.;2019;2023-07-04 07:34:23;2024-01-24 08:39:25;;8-23;;;150-151;;J.

However, habitat complexity comprises several interrelated attributes, such as number, size, and spatial arrangement of complexity-forming elements. Understanding the roles of these attributes in determining how associated organisms use biogenic habitats remains an elusive task. Here, we assessed the relationships between several structural-complexity attributes of the kelp Lessonia trabeculata and the abundance and distribution of egg depositions by the red-spotted catshark Schroederichthys chilensis. Over 1 yr, we conducted seasonal SCUBA surveys (i.e. ca. every 10 wk) of egg capsule depositions across individual and patch scales. The number of eggs per kelp plant was modeled as a function of kelp maximum frond length, holdfast diameter, number of stipes, percentage cover, plant density, and plant aggregation. The analysis of zero-inflated generalized linear models and second-order Akaike’s information criterion indicated that the models incorporating maximum frond length and percentage cover consistently showed the best balance between fit and complexity. In general, these attributes were positively, but not necessarily linearly, linked to egg counts. The presence of egg capsules in advanced developmental stages at the end of the year indicated a high temporal persistence of eggs, particularly those occurring in taller, thicker kelps. These findings suggest that catsharks select for taller, physically stable, and thicker kelps to deposit egg capsules. Moreover, our results allow us to enhance the accuracy of the definition of shark nursery grounds, a central concept for shark conservation. © Inter-Research 2019.;2019;2023-07-04 07:34:27;2024-01-22 10:58:02;;125-135;;;610;;Mar.

However, seagrass populations are currently impacted by a range of biotic and abiotic stressors, and many are in decline globally. As such, improved understanding of seagrass populations and their associated faunal assemblages is needed to better detect and predict changes in the structure and functioning of these key habitats. Here, we analyzed a large dataset—collected by recreational scuba divers volunteering on a citizen science project—to examine spatiotemporal patterns in ecological structure and to provide a robust and reliable baseline against which to detect future change. Seagrass (Zostera marina) shoot density and the abundance of associated faunal groups were quantified across 2 years at 19 sites nested within three locations in southwest UK, by collecting in situ quadrat samples (2,518 in total) during 328 dives. Seagrass shoot density and meadow fragmentation was comparable across locations but was highly variable among sites. Faunal abundance and assemblage structure varied between areas with or without seagrass shoots; this pattern was largely consistent between locations and years. Overall, increased seagrass density was related to increased faunal abundance and explained shifts in faunal assemblage structure, although individual faunal groups were affected differently. More broadly, our study shows that well-funded and orchestrated citizen science projects can, to some extent, gather fundamental information needed to benchmark ecological structure in poorly studied nearshore marine habitats. © 2019 The Authors.

This spatio-temporal pattern emerged because most eelgrass-associated taxa tracked the decline in eelgrass biomass from summer to spring, but in one case reached greater density in spring when predation intensity was low. Among 21 taxa (26,884 individuals) captured, a strong correlation arose between structure association and summer dominance, and certain functional traits, in particular morphology and on- vs. off-bottom position, were strong predictors of eelgrass association. Structure-associated taxa were slender-bodied and pelagic schooling fishes, while habitat generalists or bare-associated taxa were more consistent seasonally, primarily benthic, and cryptically colored with sand. Estuarine use (transient, reproducing, or estuarine resident) was not a strong predictor of structure association or seasonality. Because an identical sampling design was used in five regions of Washington State, USA, coarse-scale (> 100 km) differentiation in nekton assemblages was identified, representing less of the total variation than across seasons but more than across different habitats. While regional nekton differences were attributable in part to geographic distance and eelgrass morphotypes, the most seasonally variable nekton were at sites with morphotypes adding the least vertical structure but highest density. These results support two mechanisms that increase seasonal variability of taxa using structured habitats, including both bottom-up provision of habitat and resources, and subsequent possibilities for negative interspecific interactions and top-down control. © 2019, The Author(s).;2019;2023-07-04 07:34:28;2024-01-22 15:43:00;;;;6;166;;Mar.

The present study investigated the effects of Diopatra cuprea tubes on the structure of the macrobenthic fauna found on a sandy beach of the Amazon coast. Samples were collected in June (rainy season) and September (dry season) 2012 in two different areas: (1) an area in which D. cuprea tubes were present, and (2) a control area, in which worm tubes were absent. A total of 53 taxa were found, of which 30 were associated exclusively with D. cuprea tubes. While large aggregations of D. cuprea were not found in the study area, the presence of even a single tube may have a significant influence on the environmental conditions available for other organisms, especially those adapted to consolidated or muddy substrates. The two areas presented different seasonal patterns. A significant increase in the abundance and richness of the macrofauna was observed in area 1 in the rainy season, when the density of worm tubes increased and the hydrodynamic conditions were less intense. The results of the study highlight the importance of this organism as an ecosystem engineer on the sandy beaches of the Amazon coast. © Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom 2018.;2019;2023-07-04 07:34:30;2024-01-22 15:24:40;;751-759;;4;99;;J.

However, in heterogeneous landscapes, similar habitat types occur in different environmental contexts. In the marine realm, landscape studies have been confined to particular environments, rather than encompassing entire seascapes, due to incompatible sampling methods required in different situations. Objectives: We examined the interactive structuring effects of local habitat characteristics and environmental context on assemblage composition. Methods: We used a single technique—remote underwater video census—to explore the importance of habitat type (biotic structural components, substrate, and depth) and environmental context (marine vs estuarine) in structuring juvenile fish assemblages throughout an entire coastal region. In this model system, a range of structural habitat types were present in both estuarine and marine contexts. Results: The 1315 video surveys collected show a clear hierarchy in the organisation of juvenile fish communities, with assemblages first distinguished by environmental context, then by habitat type. Marine and estuarine mangroves contained entirely different assemblages, and likewise for rocky reefs and submerged aquatic vegetation. Our results suggest that two functionally different ‘seascape nursery’ types exist at local scales within a single region, defined by their context. Conclusions: The context of a location can be of greater significance in determining potential habitat function than what habitat-forming biota and substrates are present, and apparently similar habitat types in different contexts may be functionally distinct. These findings have important implications for local-scale management and conservation of juvenile fish habitats, particularly in regard to offsetting and restoration. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.;2019;2023-07-04 07:34:33;2024-01-24 11:46:54;;427-442;;2;34;;Landsc.

This trend has been attributed to changes in land use and increasing coastal development, which are activities likely to continue with governments supporting ongoing economic growth within the marine realm. This can compromise biodiversity, and biodiversity offsetting is increasingly being heralded as a means to reduce the conflict between development and conservation. Offset schemes are often evaluated against targets of ‘ecological equivalence’ or ‘like-for-like’ but these terms can be difficult to define and quantify. Although targets of equivalence have been generally shown to be feasible in terrestrial environments, the complex and dynamic nature of the marine and coastal realms present difficulties when aiming for strict equivalence targets as measures of success. Here, we investigated four intertidal biogenic reef habitats formed by the tube worm Sabellaria alveolata within, and in proximity to, Swansea Bay (Wales, UK). The aim was to identify measurable biodiversity components for S. alveolata reef habitat, and to investigate the natural spatio-temporal variation in these components, to determine whether a target of equivalence was feasible. We also looked to identify the most important drivers of species assemblages within the reefs. Results showed that biodiversity both S. alveolata formation and tube aperture condition showed a significant interaction between site and season, with community composition varying significantly by site only. Site was found to explain the highest variation in community composition, followed by substrate type, and geographical position. These results highlight how widely coastal habitats can vary, in both space and time, and therefore calls into question a strict target of ecological equivalence when planning biodiversity offsets in coastal environments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;2019;2023-07-04 07:34:34;2024-01-22 12:51:36;;97-111;;;177;;Ocean Coast.

This study investigated the effect of the macroalgal host species on an assemblage of associated amphipods, and tested if the host mediates the vulnerability of amphipods to predation. The association of amphipods with the macroalgal hosts Dichotomaria marginata, Padina gymnospora, and Sargassum filipendula was evaluated seasonally for 1 year on a subtropical rocky shore on the southeastern coast of Brazil. The density of amphipods did not vary with season or host. However, the composition of amphipod species was sensitive to the host macroalgal species and varied temporally. A field experiment showed no clear effect of predation on the amphipod assemblage. Also, predation did not explain the spatial or temporal variation of the amphipod assemblage. Our results indicate that the identity of the macroalgal host drove the composition of the associated amphipods, while predation may have a minor role. Therefore, the loss of habitat-forming organisms such as seaweeds is expected to have drastic consequences for the composition of associated fauna, and consequently on the flow of matter and energy in coastal ecosystems. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;2019;2023-07-04 07:34:37;2024-01-24 08:50:59;;;;;;;Hydrobiologia;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Habitat; Macrophytes; Associated fauna; Species composition; Shallow subtidal; BIODIVERSITY; MARINE; ABUNDANCE; COMMUNITY; MOBILE EPIFAUNA; HABITAT COMPLEXITY; FOOD; FISH PREDATION; ALGAL TURF; SARGASSUM-STENOPHYLLUM; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We saw a clear positive relationship with the condition of P. australis; a high cover of this seagrass had positive effects on the diversity and abundance of cryptic fauna.

Many macrophytes are foundation species in coastal habitats, supporting much of the biodiversity of these ecosystems by providing essential resources such as food and habitat. The addition of invasive species strongly contributes to habitat modification, but the bottom-up impacts of non-native macroalgae on higher trophic levels remains difficult to predict. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the invasive macroalga Asparagopsis taxiformis on biodiversity by comparing the mobile macrofauna inhabiting this species to the dominant native species Halopteris scoparia. This is the first comprehensive study of the possible effects of this widespread invasive species on higher trophic levels. A hierarchical sampling design with two different spatial scales was conducted to explore the consistency of the patterns observed. Fifty-nine species belonging to superorder Peracarida were found, accounting 90% of all organisms. A. taxiformis hosted an impoverished epifaunal assemblage in comparison to that associated with the native seaweed, showing significantly lower values of diversity, abundance and number of epifaunal species across study locations. The structure of the associated macrofauna (both in terms of species composition, variability among samples and relative abundance of the species) was also different. Our results highlighted the strong influence of A. taxiformis in the resident community, with differences among the two macroalgae in all the parameters considered. Finally, our results also reflect a biotic homogenization of the epifaunal assemblages associated to A. taxiformis, a scarcely explored consequence of invasive processes in marine environments. Future studies exploring the cascading effects of the observed changes in the epifaunal assemblages would be necessary in order to estimate system responses to macroalgal invasions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;2018;2023-07-04 07:34:39;2024-01-24 14:15:49;;44-52;;;141;;Mar.

Habitat geometry influences the abundance and distribution of species through an interplay between habitat area and perimeter. However, few studies have tested the interacting effects of these distinct geometry parameters on community and ecosystem dynamics. We used experimental mussel (Mytilus spp.) beds as a model system to control and test for the effect of perimeter, area and their interaction on the diversity and abundance of macro-invertebrate species associated with mussel beds and on ecosystem functions (ammonium and oxygen fluxes). Live blue mussels were used to create artificial mussel transplants corresponding to 9 factorial combinations of area and perimeter, and both community and ecosystem effects were assessed after a 2 mo colonization period in the field. Our results showed an interacting and scale-dependent effect of area and perimeter on both community and ecosystem characteristics: area had a negative effect on taxonomic diversity of small-perimeter transplants, and perimeter had a negative effect on diversity of small-area transplants. At the ecosystem level, ammonium release increased with area in large-perimeter transplants. This study stresses the importance of integrating the explicit and interactive effects of multiple metrics of habitat shape for resolving the relationship between community dynamics and ecosystem functions in fragmented habitats. © Inter-Research 2019·;2019;2023-07-04 07:34:43;2024-07-16 13:15:54;;149-163;;;608;;Mar.

In many marine and terrestrial systems, facilitation cascades where primary foundation and/or autogenic ecosystem engineering species promote the settlement and survival of a secondary foundation/engineering species have been shown to enhance local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We experimentally tested if a facilitation cascade occurs among eelgrass (Zostera marina), pen clams (Atrina rigida), and community diversity in temperate seagrass beds in North Carolina, U.S.A., and if this sequence of direct positive interactions created feedbacks that affected various metrics of seagrass ecosystem function and structure. Using a combination of surveys and transplant experiments, we found that pen clam density and survivorship was significantly greater in seagrass beds, indicating that eelgrass facilitates pen clams. Pen clams in turn enhanced local diversity and increased both the abundance and species richness of organisms (specifically, macroalgae and fouling invertebrate fauna)-the effect of which scaled with increasing clam density. However, we failed to detect an impact of pen clams on other seagrass functions and hypothesize that functioning may more likely be enhanced in scenarios where secondary foundation species specifically increase the diversity of key functional groups such as epiphyte grazers and/or when bivalves are infaunal rather than epifaunal. Our findings add to the growing amount of literature that demonstrates that secondary foundation species are important drivers of local biodiversity in marine ecosystems. Further experimentation is needed that directly examines (i) the role of functional versus overall diversity on seagrass functions and (ii) the relative importance of life-history strategy in determining when and where engineering bivalves increase biodiversity and/or functioning of seagrass beds. © 2019 by the authors.;2019;2023-07-04 07:34:44;2024-01-22 09:22:57;;;;3;11;;Diversity;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Ecosystem engineers; seagrasses; ecosystem engineers; facilitation; ecosystem engineering; foundation species; Bivalvia; Foundation species; seagrass; biodiversity; Bivalves; ecosystem function; species richness; bivalve; Zostera marina; bivalves; United States; Seagrasses; species diversity; facilitation cascade; Facilitation cascade; North Carolina; Invertebrata; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; EELGRASS ZOSTERA-MARINA; POSITIVE INTERACTIONS; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; MYTILUS-EDULIS; FRESH-WATER; SUSPENSION-FEEDING BIVALVES; TOP-DOWN CONTROL; SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA PRODUCTION; HABITAT MODIFICATION; biodiversity-ecosystem function; Atrina rigida; Biodiversity- ecosystem function; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Here we examined whether facilitation of the invasive porcelain crab Petrolisthes elongatus by the ecosystem engineering serpulid tube worm Galeolaria caespitosa increased with wave exposure. Petrolisthes occurs beneath intertidal boulders which often have a high cover of Galeolaria on their underside. Surveys across nine sites demonstrated Petrolisthes abundance beneath boulders increased with wave exposure and Galeolaria cover, although only when the habitat matrix beneath boulders was rock or mixed rock and sand. Moreover, as wave exposure increased, the strength of relationship between Petrolisthes abundance and the surface area of Galeolaria also increased. Experimentally, the presence of Galeolaria on the underside of boulders increased Petrolisthes abundance by 50% compared to boulders lacking Galeolaria. Our findings suggest the facilitative role of Galeolaria is stronger at more wave-exposed sites, which appears to contribute to a higher abundance of invasive Petrolisthes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;2018;2023-07-04 07:34:46;2024-01-24 13:20:19;;124-129;;;;;Mar.

During the study period, there was little variation in holdfast height and diameter, which ranged from 5.9 to 8.5 cm and from 7.1 to 10.8 cm, respectively. In total 7087 animals were collected from 40 holdfasts (177.2 individuals inds./holdfast, on average). The number of mobile invertebrates gradually increased from May (15 ± 9.9 inds./holdfast) to August (346 ± 152.5 inds./holdfast), with over 300 inds./holdfast until October before rapidly decreasing in November (110 ± 85.6 inds./holdfast). Similarly, taxon richness increased gradually from April (4.3 ± 1.0 taxa/holdfast) to August (11.0 ± 3.7 taxa/holdfast), and decreased in November (8.6 ± 2.3 taxa/holdfast). Interestingly, hundreds of mobile invertebrates inhabited holdfasts of kelp plants that had shed their blade in October and November. Taxon composition from August to October and the number of invertebrates from July to November were comparable to data previously reported for perennial kelps. In this study, the importance of annual Ecklonian species as biogenic habitats was demonstrated for the first time. © 2018 Japanese Society of Phycology;2019;2023-07-04 07:34:47;2024-01-24 13:20:19;;51-58;;1;67;;Phycol.

Understanding the response and resilience of communities that face multiple simultaneous disturbances and stresses becomes essential. We observed the recovery of a rocky intertidal subarctic macrobenthic community dominated by a macroalgal canopy (Fucus spp.), a habitat-forming species, over a period of 14 months. Using 0.25-m2 plots, we ran an in situ one-pulse experiment (removal of all materials to bare rock and then burning of the surface) followed by a full orthogonal factorial design of three press-type disturbances or stresses: grazer reduction, canopy removal, and nutrient enrichment. We evaluated the single and interactive effects of the three disturbances and stresses on species diversity and abundance structure. Of all the main effects, canopy removal has the most severe impact, resulting in decreased biomass, richness, and diversity, as well as an altered community structure. Canopy-removed plots had fewer invertebrates and more ephemeral algae; beyond this, however, there was minimal effect from grazer reduction and nutrient enrichment acting individually. We categorized the interaction types of all significant interaction effects: Canopy removal had a dominant effect over grazer reduction on richness, and it also dominated over nutrient enrichment on diversity and evenness. Nutrient enrichment and canopy removal had a negative synergistic interaction effect on richness at the end of the experiment. Without stressors, 11 months were required to achieve full recovery. The three stressors affected recovery time differently, depending on the identity and the number of stressors. Three stressors generally increased the time of recovery or even prevented recovery from being fully attained. Moreover, community structure and composition of plots subjected to the triple-stressor treatment had not fully recovered by the end of the study. Our results suggest that multiple stressors may interact on community indices and structure and that their interaction cannot be predicted from the outcome of single stressor studies. The inclusion of multiple disturbances and stresses in field experiments provides a better understanding of the mechanisms that shape community structure and their functioning following various forms of disturbance. © 2018 The Authors.";2018;2023-07-04 07:34:49;2024-01-29 10:54:31;;;;10;9;;Ecosphere;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"foundation species; epifauna; recovery; rocky shores; assemblage structure; nutrient addition; cumulative impact; grazers, macroalgae; non-additive interaction; field experimentation; manipulative study; NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; CURRENT KNOWLEDGE; LIFE-HISTORY; BOTTOM-UP; BIODIVERSITY LOSS; ST-LAWRENCE; ROCKY-SHORE COMMUNITIES; CLIMATE-RELATED DISTURBANCE; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We, hereby, characterised the molluscan assemblages associated with three Cystoseira taxa (C. amentacea, C. compressa and C. crinita) from Ischia Island (Italy, Tyrrhenian Sea), and tested whether different congeneric taxa may syntopically support a different biota. In particular, these assemblages were compared among three Cystoseira species, between two times of sampling (June-July 2015 and June-July 2016), and among six sites in terms of multivariate structure (identity and relative abundances of constituting taxa combined, and presence-absence composition), as well as for synthetic measures of diversity, including the total richness of taxa, the exponential Shannon index and the reciprocal Simpson index. In total, 24 736 molluscan individuals were collected, overall belonging to 52 taxa. The majority of the identified species included micrograzers and filter feeders, which is in agreement with similar previous studies. The composition of associated molluscan assemblages, which was mainly represented by juvenile individuals, differed among the three Cystoseira species, suggesting that even congeneric taxa do not support an analogous benthic fauna. The present findings have shed light on the molluscan biota associated with Cystoseira taxa in the Gulf of Naples and strengthened the importance of such habitat-forming macroalgae in structuring the local infralittoral invertebrate biodiversity and as a nursery for species-specific associated molluscs. © 2019 CSIRO.;2019;2023-07-04 07:34:49;2024-01-24 09:23:10;;1561-1575;;11;70;;Mar.

Yet, almost all current reef management is biased towards shallow reefs, and overlooks that coral reefs extend beyond shallow waters to mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs; 30-150 m). We present the first detailed quantitative characterization of MCEs off Cozumel, Mexico, on the northern Mesoamerican Reef in the Mexican Caribbean, and provide insights into their general state. We documented MCE biodiversity, and assessed whether MCEs adjacent to a major town and port, where coastal development has caused shallow reef damage, have similar benthic and fish communities to MCEs within a National Park. Our results show that overall MCE communities are similar regardless of protection, though some taxa-specific differences exist in benthic communities between sites within the MPA and areas outside. Regardless of protection and location, and in contrast to shallow reefs, all observed Cozumel MCEs were continuous reefs with the main structural habitat complexity provided by calcareous macroalgae, sponges, gorgonians and black corals. Hard corals were present on MCEs, although at low abundance. We found that 42.5% of fish species recorded on Cozumel could be found on both shallow reefs and MCEs, including 39.6% of commercially valuable fish species. These results suggest that MCEs could play an important role in supporting fish populations. However, regardless of protection and depth, we found few large-body fishes (greater than 500 mm), which were nearly absent at all studied sites. Cozumel MCEs contain diverse benthic and fish assemblages, including commercially valuable fisheries species and ecosystem engineers, such as black corals. Because of their inherent biodiversity and identified threats, MCEs should be incorporated into shallow-reef-focused Cozumel National Park management plan. © 2018 The Authors.";2018;2023-07-04 07:34:50;2024-01-24 14:54:28;;;;10;5;;R.

This gap in knowledge exists in part because of the rarity of ecologically meaningful studies capable of disentangling different elements of disturbance. Hence, we carried out a long-term (9 yr), large-scale (2,000 m2 plots), spatially replicated (4 sites) field experiment in which we manipulated disturbance to a globally distributed marine foundation species, the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, and tracked community responses over time. To distinguish the effects of disturbance frequency and severity on the biodiversity and composition of temperate rocky reef communities, we simulated the repeated loss of giant kelp from destructive winter waves across a background of natural variation in disturbance. By following the response of over 200 taxa from the surrounding community, we discovered that the frequency of disturbance to giant kelp changed the biomass, diversity, and composition of community guilds in a manner commensurate with their dependence on the physical (i.e., benthic light and space), trophic (i.e., living and detrital biomass), and habitat (i.e., biogenic structure) resources mediated by this foundation species. Annual winter disturbance to giant kelp reduced living and detrital giant kelp biomass by 57% and 40%, respectively, enhanced bottom light by 22%, and halved the seafloor area covered by giant kelp holdfasts. Concomitantly, the biomass of understory algae and epilithic sessile invertebrates more than doubled, while the biomass of rock-boring clams, mobile invertebrates, and fishes decreased 30–61%. Frequent loss of giant kelp boosted understory algal richness by 82% and lowered sessile invertebrate richness by 13% but did not affect the biodiversity of mobile fauna. In contrast to changes driven by disturbance frequency, interannual variation in the severity of disturbance to giant kelp had weaker, less consistent effects, causing only modest changes in assemblages of sessile invertebrates, mobile invertebrate herbivores, and fishes. Our results broaden the foundation species concept by demonstrating that repeated disturbance to a dominant habitat-forming species can outweigh the influence of less frequent but severe disturbances for the surrounding community. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America;2018;2023-07-04 07:34:50;2024-01-29 11:00:07;;2442-2454;;11;99;;Ecology;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Animals; Ecosystem; species interactions; Kelp; competition; kelp forest; Bivalvia; Invertebrates; biodiversity; rocky shore; habitat; species richness; disturbance; ecosystem; algae; kelp; Macrocystis pyrifera; community structure; field experiment; forest; guild; invertebrate; resources; understory; Macrocystis; marine environment; dominant species; long-term ecological research; wave disturbance; rarity; long-term change; Pisces; animal; sessile species; environmental disturbance; Forests; temperate environment; competition (ecology); Invertebrata; experimental study; community response; PATTERNS; GIANT-KELP; DIVERSITY; GROWTH; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; DYNAMICS; COEXISTENCE; INTENSITY; MACROALGAL ASSEMBLAGES; HYPOTHESIS; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We examined the relationship between morphological variation in Hormosira and associated gastropod community structure, abundance and diversity in Tasmania, southern Australia. We sampled both Hormosira and gastropods from sites in two habitats (coast and estuary), two times (February-March and October-November) at two regions (northern and eastern Tasmania). There were distinct Hormosira morphs on the north coast (small individuals), east coast (intermediate sized individuals) and in estuaries (large individuals). Multivariate analysis showed that gastropod communities varied among the different algal morphologies, and suggest an influence of morphological traits, specifically thallus length, vesicle number and size, on the distribution patterns of gastropod species. Despite the finding of distinct gastropod communities associated with the different Hormosira morphs, because the different morphs occur in different locations with different physical conditions, we cannot unequivocally attribute the differences in gastropod communities to seaweed morphology per se. Nonetheless, our results confirm that H. banksii is an important foundation species in the intertidal zone and suggest a habitat-specific effect of algal morphological traits on gastropods. © 2019 CSIRO.;2019;2023-07-04 07:34:51;2024-01-24 09:09:48;;280-291;;2;70;;Mar.

In the present study, intertidal macrobenthic communities of three habitats – a non-vegetated tidal flat (TF), a marsh with the smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora (SA) and a Kandelia candel mangrove forest (KC) – were examined during periods of ebb tide in February, May, August and November 2015 in Ximen Island Special Marine Protected Area, Zhejiang Province, China. S. alterniflora was introduced from North America in 1979 and invaded Ximen Island spontaneously. K. candel was a direct, artificial introduction in 1957 from Fujian, China. A total of 48 species of macrobenthos were collected from Ximen Island. The average density of macrobenthos in TF, SA and KC was 1365, 1398 and 669 ind./m2, respectively, and the average biomass of macrobenthos in TF, SA and KC was 144.13, 43.00 and 138.70 g/m2, respectively. There were no significant differences among the three habitats on density and biomass of macrobenthos, with the exception of density in spring and biomass in autumn. Diversity indices of macrobenthos did not exhibit significant differences among the three habitats, except for Margalef's richness index (d) in KC. However, Results of one-way analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) revealed significant differences in macrobenthic community structure among the three habitats and four seasons. It was concluded that, although few significant differences were observed in the density, biomass and diversity indices of macrobenthos among habitats, there were significant changes in the macrobenthic communities’ structure after the introduction of S. alterniflora and K. candel. Therefore, when we use plants as ecological engineering materials, we need to take into account all of their potential ecological consequences. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;2018;2023-07-04 07:34:54;2024-01-24 14:22:23;;96-104;;;112;;Ecol.

It is an important ecosystem engineer and, due to its ecological value, is protected by international convention. The aim of this study is to investigate the mollusc composition and diversity occurring within Spanish vermetid bioconstructions. During the late summer 2013, three distant sites along the Mediterranean coast of Spain were sampled by scraping off the vermetid shells to study their associated assemblages. A total of 600 molluscs were identified within the classes of Polyplacophora (four species), Gastropoda (35 spp.) and Bivalvia (18 spp.). Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences in composition and trophic diversity of mollusc assemblages among the three sites, highlighting a clear geographical gradient. Overall, both herbivores (grazers and deposit feeders) and omnivores were the quantitatively dominant trophic groups, while carnivores (predators and ectoparasites) were very scarce. Our results point out that mollusc assemblages associated with vermetid bioconstructions are rich and diversified, both in populations structure and trophic diversity, confirming the important role of vermetid gastropods as ecosystem engineers and biodiversity enhancers in shallow coastal waters. © 2018 by the authors.;2018;2023-07-04 07:34:57;2024-01-29 10:29:08;;;;3;10;;Diversity;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Bivalvia; shell; Mollusca; Intertidal; Mediterranean Sea; population structure; intertidal environment; species diversity; trophic structure; gastropod; Spain; Gastropoda; Polyplacophora; snail; assessment method; Dendropoma; Vermetidae; Mediterranean Coast [Spain]; Mollusc diversity; Trophic categories; PATTERNS; MEDITERRANEAN SEA; BIODIVERSITY; REEF; FAUNA; MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS; SCALES; SHORES; TRICOLIA; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To broaden the understanding of the impact of a globally widespread invasive oyster, Crassostrea (Magallana) gigas, intertidal surveys were carried out at 15 different sites in Europe. The impact of C. gigas on macro- (taxa surrounding oyster > 1 cm) and epifaunal (taxa on oyster < 1 cm) benthic communities and α and β-diversity was assessed and compared to those associated with native ecosystem engineers, including the flat oyster Ostrea edulis. Whilst the effect of C. gigas on benthic community structures was dependent on habitat type, epifaunal communities associated with low densities of O. edulis and C. gigas did not differ and changes in benthic assemblage structure owing to the abundance of C. gigas were therefore attributed to the presence of oyster shells. Macrofaunal α-diversity increased with C. gigas cover in muddy habitats, while epifaunal α-diversity decreased at greater oyster densities. Macrofaunal β-diversity was greatest at low densities of C. gigas; however, it did not differ between samples without and increased densities of oysters. In contrast, epifaunal β-diversity decreased with increasing oyster cover. Different environmental contexts enabled more independent predictions of the effect of C. gigas on native communities. These were found to be low and more importantly not differing from O. edulis.

This study examines the patterns of diversity, abundance and structure of gorgonian epifaunal communities found in Ecuador, a well-recognized marine biodiversity hot spot. Within this area, Leptogorgia manabiensis and L. obscura represent two of the most abundant and widely distributed gorgonian species, each with differing morphological characteristics. Epifaunal communities associated with these host species were analyzed during both the cold (June) and warm (November) seasons over two consecutive years. Both species were shown to be highly effective benthic biodiversity ecosystem engineers, hosting denser communities than other related organisms such as scleractinians, other gorgonians, algae, sponges, hydrocorals and bryozoans, as well as other geographic areas. A complex pattern of biodiversity was observed, with each gorgonian species hosting distinct communities: The fan-shaped L. manabiensis had a less diverse community dominated by echinoderms (mainly ophiuroids), while the bush-shaped L. obscura was dominated by crustaceans (mainly amphipods). Although the morphology of L. obscura allowed for greater living space for associated fauna, this species exhibited a less dense epifaunal community than of L. manabiensis. A seasonal fluctuation in abundance was also observed. Abundance tended to be greater in the cold season (June), likely due to the influence of the cold, nutrient-rich Humboldt Current, than in the warm season (November), when the warm, nutrient-poor Panama Current dominates. Diversity was not affected by seasonal fluctuations and remained constant throughout the year. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;2018;2023-07-04 07:34:59;2024-01-24 13:20:22;;723-736;;3;37;;Coral Reefs;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"ecosystem engineering; epifauna; morphology; biodiversity; benthos; Ecosystem engineer; abundance; algae; community structure; Crustacea; Echinodermata; coral; species diversity; coral reef; epibiont; Ophiuroidea; Bryozoa; Scleractinia; amphipod; Amphipoda; Octocoral; Anthozoa; Epibionts; Ecuador; Pacific Ocean; Gorgonacea; Gorgonia; Stylasteridae; Pacific Ocean (East); EL-NINO; CORAL-REEFS; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; SPECIES RICHNESS; CNIDARIA; SHALLOW-WATER; Humboldt Current; HUMBOLDT CURRENT SYSTEM; HYDROID ASSEMBLAGES; Leptogorgia; OCTOCORALLIA GORGONIIDAE; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In recent decades, many kelp habitats have transformed into turf-dominated communities. This represents a fundamental change in the overall habitat structure in these communities, with an unknown impact on upper trophic level organisms. We investigated how macroalgae morphology affects a common residential mid-trophic level wrasse, Tautogolabrus adspersus (cunner), which utilizes macroalgae for both refuge and foraging. Three studies were conducted: in situ behavioral video observations, a refuge choice experiment, and a foraging efficiency experiment. Video observations revealed that in kelp-dominated and mixed habitat types cunner use macroalgae more often for refuge than for foraging, but in turf-dominated habitats refuge and foraging events were equal. In these habitats, refuge-seeking was more often associated with a tall, morphologically simple kelp. The refuge choice experiment supported our video observations with cunner preferentially seeking refuge beneath taller but less morphologically complex algae instead of shorter filamentous forms. In predation trials, macroalgae complexity did not significantly affect the number of prey the fish captured. Our results provide evidence that the refuge-seeking behavior of this residential mid-trophic level fish may be impacted by the ongoing shifts in macroalgae dominance in the Gulf of Maine. Loss of its preferred refuge (tall, canopy-forming kelps) may force it to use the less-preferred introduced turf algae instead. However, whether turf provides sufficient protection for this species remains unclear. With the ongoing loss of kelp in temperate coastal ecosystems worldwide, it is important to understand the potential indirect effects that changes in habitat structure will have on the trophic interactions of upper level organisms. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;2018;2023-07-04 07:35:01;2024-01-24 14:13:29;;1-8;;;506;;J.

Giant kelp has long been considered a marine foundation species due to its complex structure and high productivity; however, there is little quantitative evidence to evaluate this. Here, we apply structural equation modelling to a 15-year time series of reef community data to evaluate how giant kelp affects the reef community. Although species richness was positively associated with giant kelp biomass, most direct paths did not involve giant kelp. Instead, the foundational qualities of giant kelp were driven mostly by indirect effects attributed to its dominant physical structure and associated engineering influence on the ecosystem, rather than by its use as food by invertebrates and fishes. Giant kelp structure has indirect effects because it shades out understorey algae that compete with sessile invertebrates. When released from competition, sessile species in turn increase the diversity of mobile predators. Sea urchin grazing effects could have been misinterpreted as kelp effects, because sea urchins can overgraze giant kelp, understorey algae and sessile invertebrates alike. Our results confirm the high diversity and biomass associated with kelp forests, but highlight how species interactions and habitat attributes can be misconstrued as direct consequences of a foundation species like giant kelp. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.";2018;2023-07-04 07:35:02;2024-01-24 14:20:12;;;;1874;285;;Proc.

We examined community-level impacts of observed climate-driven shifts in the relative abundances of two superficially similar HFS, the warm-water kelp Laminaria ochroleuca and the cool-water kelp Laminaria hyperborea. Location: Western English Channel, north-east Atlantic. Methods: We compared algal and invertebrate assemblages associated with kelp stipes and holdfasts, across multiple sites and sampling events. Significant differences were recorded in the structure of assemblages between the host kelp species at each site and event. Results: Assemblages associated with stipes of the cool-water HFS were, on average, >12 times more diverse and supported >3600 times more biomass compared with the warm-water HFS. Holdfast assemblages also differed significantly between species, although to a lesser extent than those associated with stipes. Overall, assemblages associated with the warm-water HFS were markedly impoverished and comprised far fewer rare or unique taxa. Main conclusions: While previous research has shown how climate-driven loss of HFS can cause biodiversity loss, our study demonstrates that climate-driven substitutions of HFS can also lead to impoverished assemblages. The indirect effects of climate change remain poorly resolved, but shifts in the distributions and abundances of HFS may invoke widespread ecological change, especially in marine ecosystems where facilitative interactions are particularly strong. © 2018 The Authors.

In particular, activities that locally affect marine habitat-forming foundation species may perturb habitat and promote species with generalist, opportunistic traits, in turn affecting spatial patterns of biodiversity. Here, we quantified fish diversity in seagrass communities across 89 sites spanning 6° latitude along the Pacific coast of Canada, to test the hypothesis that anthropogenic disturbances homogenize (i.e., lower beta-diversity) assemblages within coastal ecosystems. We test for patterns of biotic homogenization at sites within different anthropogenic disturbance categories (low, medium, and high) at two spatial scales (within and across regions) using both abundance- and incidence-based beta-diversity metrics. Our models provide clear evidence that fish communities in high anthropogenic disturbance seagrass areas are homogenized relative to those in low disturbance areas. These results were consistent across within-region comparisons using abundance- and incidence-based measures of beta-diversity, and in across-region comparisons using incidence-based measures. Physical and biotic characteristics of seagrass meadows also influenced fish beta-diversity. Biotic habitat characteristics including seagrass biomass and shoot density were more differentiated among high disturbance sites, potentially indicative of a perturbed environment. Indicator species and trait analyses revealed fishes associated with low disturbance sites had characteristics including stenotopy, lower swimming ability, and egg guarding behavior. Our study is the first to show biotic homogenization of fishes across seagrass meadows within areas of relatively high human impact. These results support the importance of targeting conservation efforts in low anthropogenic disturbance areas across land- and seascapes, as well as managing anthropogenic impacts in high activity areas. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd;2018;2023-07-04 07:35:06;2024-01-24 14:35:42;;1904-1918;;5;24;;Global Change Biol.;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Biodiversity; Animals; seagrass; biodiversity; species richness; fish; biotic homogenization; Canada; classification; beta-diversity; nearshore; anthropogenic impact; marine fishes; human; Pisces; Fishes; animal; Humans; Pacific Ocean; human activities; Human Activities; community turnover; BIODIVERSITY; HABITATS; SPECIES RICHNESS; FOOD WEBS; ZOSTERA-MARINA; ASSEMBLAGES; BETA-DIVERSITY; NURSERY ROLE; SIMILARITY; BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Mytilus edulis beds have myriad effects on sediment, benthic organisms, and ecosystem processes such as hydrodynamic transport of sediment and animals. When mussels die, they may leave behind massive amounts of whole (empty) and fragmented shells. The legacy effects of this long-lasting biogenic material (i.e., shell hash) on benthic systems are poorly understood. We measured percent cover values of 4 bottom cover types, i.e., live mussels, whole shells, fragmented shells, and bare sediment, at the mussel bed in Carrying Place Cove, Harrington, Maine, USA, and examined their effects on sediment characteristics, community structure of macrofauna and meiofauna, and ecosystem processes of sediment flux and dispersal of postlarval macrofauna and meiofauna. We predicted that live mussels are the cover type with the greatest effects compared to bare sediment, followed by fragmented shells and then whole shells. We discovered mostly bare sediment, substantial cover of whole and fragmented shells, and almost no live mussels in what had in past years been a robust bed. We found significant univariate and multivariate differences in sediment and animals across cover types, especially for meiofauna. Fragmented shell material in particular may be an important driver in this system. Our results are the first to quantify the 4 mussel bed cover types and demonstrate their effects. Mussel beds in the Gulf of Maine have experienced severe declines in the past two decades, attributed primarily to climate change and the invasive green crab, Carcinus maenas. Our results may be useful in predicting the responses of soft-bottom systems as intact mussel beds die off, leaving large areas of bare sediment and shell hash. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;2018;2023-07-04 07:35:06;2024-01-29 10:51:42;;30-41;;;506;;J.

Often these shifts involve introduced species that are morphologically dissimilar to native species, creating a unique biogenic structure and habitat for associated species within the landscape. While community-level changes as a result of introduced species have been documented in both terrestrial and marine systems, it is still unclear how long-term shifts in species composition will affect habitat complexity or its potential to influence the biodiversity of species that occur at the base of the food web. We analysed quadrat photos collected at several subtidal sites in the Gulf of Maine over a 30+ year period, and collected individual seaweed species to determine their complexity and the biodiversity of meso-invertebrates associated with each species. By coupling the relationship of 30+ years of shifts in seaweed assemblages, morphological structure of the seaweed assemblage, and their meso-invertebrates, we determined introduced seaweeds have increased by up to 90%, corresponding to a rise in two-dimensional (2D) structure, and a decline in canopy height of subtidal rocky habitats. The highly complex two-dimensional habitat provided by introduced filamentous red seaweeds supports two to three times more meso-invertebrate individuals and species that form the base of the food web than simpler forms of morphological habitat. Synthesis. The present study demonstrates a long-term shift in foundation species towards a dominance of invasive seaweeds that directly reduce canopy height and increase the 2D biogenic structure of the habitat. These introduced seaweeds harbour greater biodiversity of species found at the base of the food web than seaweeds with simpler forms such as the native kelp species. Such shifts in habitat structure will propagate to food webs by influencing the structure of lower trophic-level meso-invertebrates and indirectly upper trophic-level species that feed on these invertebrates and use the seaweed structure as refuge. © 2017 The Authors.

These structures are known to modify the local grain-size distribution and to host a highly diversified macrofauna, altered when the reef undergoes disturbances. The goal of this study was to investigate the different sedimentary and biological changes associated with the presence of a S. alveolata reef over two contrasting seasons (late winter and late summer), and how these changes were linked. Three different sediments were considered: the engineered sediment (the actual reef), the associated sediment (the soft sediment surrounding the reef structures) and a control soft sediment (i.e. no reef structures in close proximity). Univariate and multivariate comparisons of grain-size distribution, soft sediment characteristics (organic matter content, chlorophyll a, pheopigments and carbohydrate concentrations) and macrofauna were conducted between the different sediment types at both seasons and between the two seasons for each sediment type. A distance-based redundancy analyses (dbRDA) was used to investigate the link between the different environmental parameters and the macrofauna assemblages. Finally, we focused on a disturbance continuum of the engineered sediments proxied by an increase in the mud present in these sediments. The effects of a continuous and increasing disturbance on the associated fauna were investigated using pairwise beta diversity indices (Sørensen and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities and their decomposition into turnover and nestedness). Results showed a significant effect of the reef on the local sediment distribution (coarser sediments compared to the control) and on the benthic primary production (higher in the associated sediments). At both seasons, S. alveolata biomass and sediment principal mode were the environmental parameters which best differentiated the engineered, associated and control sediment assemblages. These two parameters are under the ecosystem engineer's influence stressing its importance in structuring benthic macrofauna. Furthermore, in late summer but not in late winter, presence/absence and abundance-based beta diversity were positively correlated to our disturbance proxy (mud content) a tendency driven by a species replacement and a rise in the associated fauna density. Our first set of results highlight the importance of S. alveolata reefs as benthic primary production enhancers via their physical structure and their biological activity. The results obtained using beta diversity indices emphasize the importance of recruitment in structuring the reef's macrofauna and – paradoxically – the ecological value of S. alveolata degraded forms as biodiversity and recruitment promoters. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd;2018;2023-07-04 07:35:10;2024-01-24 14:30:57;;1-18;;;200;;Estuar.

We quantified the distribution and abundance of H. stipulacea, and its associated macroinvertebrate fauna, in sampling stations and transects around the island of Carriacou (a nearby dependency of Grenada) in early 2016. Halophila stipulacea occurred in extensive monospecific stands (average bottom cover, 62%), or smaller mixed stands with native seagrass (Thalassia testudinum, Syringodium filiforme, Halodule wrightii), at 1–5 m depth in large bays along the leeward (west) coast. It was sparsely distributed on the more wave-exposed east and south coasts, usually in mixed patches with native seagrass. In leeward bays, H. stipulacea has largely replaced the native seagrass H. wrightii, providing a novel biogenic habitat for various filter-feeding invertebrates living within the turf-like leaf canopy (e.g., sponges, ascidians, bivalves, ophiuroids), and sea urchins (mainly Tripneustes ventricousus) and a microphagous sea star (Oreaster reticulatus) that graze upon it. Populations of the sea star consisted mainly of juveniles indicating the seagrass may serve as a nursery habitat for this endangered species. The spread of H. stipulacea along the leeward coast of Carriacou in recent years represents a community-level shift in the shallow subtidal zone, with attendant changes in habitat structure, species composition, and trophic interactions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;2018;2023-07-04 07:35:10;2024-01-24 13:35:01;;1-8;;;144;;Aquatic Bot.;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Seagrass; habitat structure; Bivalvia; seagrass; Invasive species; abundance; Halophila stipulacea; Thalassia testudinum; Caribbean; invasive species; macroinvertebrate; endangered species; Species distribution; echinoderm; community composition; Ascidiacea; Ophiuroidea; Carriacou; trophic interaction; Halodule wrightii; Echinoidea; Caribbean Islands; subtidal environment; Invertebrata; population distribution; Tripneustes; Syringodium filiforme; Leeward Islands [Lesser Antilles]; Asteroidea; Grenada [Windward Islands]; Grenadines; Oreaster reticulatus; Windward Islands [Lesser Antilles]; POPULATIONS; SEA; ASTEROIDEA; ATLANTIC; EXPANSION; LIGHT; OREASTER-RETICULATUS ECHINODERMATA; ZOSTERA-JAPONICA; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A number of reef fish species use separate adult and nursery habitats, and hence contribute to nutrient and energy transfer between habitats. Seagrass beds and mangroves often constitute important nursery habitats, with high structural complexity and protection from predation. Here, we investigated if reef fish assemblages in the tropical south-western Atlantic demonstrate ontogenetic habitat connectivity and identify possible nurseries on three reef systems along the eastern Brazilian coast. Fish were surveyed in fore reef, back reef, Halodule wrightii seagrass beds and seaweed beds. Seagrass beds contained lower abundances and species richness of fish than expected, while Sargassum-dominated seaweed beds contained significantly more juveniles than all other habitats (average juvenile fish densities: 32.6 per 40 m2 in Sargassum beds, 11.2 per 40 m2 in back reef, 10.1 per 40 m2 in fore reef, and 5.04 per 40 m2 in seagrass beds), including several species that are found in the reef habitats as adults. Species that in other regions worldwide (e.g. the Caribbean) utilise seagrass beds as nursery habitats were here instead observed in Sargassum beds or back reef habitats. Coral cover was not correlated to adult fish distribution patterns; instead, type of turf was an important variable. Connectivity, and thus pathways of nutrient transfer, seems to function differently in east Brazil compared to many tropical regions. Sargassum-dominated beds might be more important as nurseries for a larger number of fish species than seagrass beds. Due to the low abundance of structurally complex seagrass beds we suggest that seaweed beds might influence adult reef fish abundances, being essential for several keystone species of reef fish in the tropical south-western Atlantic. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd";2017;2023-07-04 07:35:11;2024-01-30 09:08:25;;97-108;;;196;;Estuar.

Investigating the loss of such natural habitats in order to develop management strategies for conservation is a major challenge in marine ecological research. This study investigated the shallow rocky bottoms of the southern Bay of Biscay at two sampling times with a view to identifying the effect of canopy seaweed availability on the taxonomic and functional properties of invertebrate multivariate structure, abundance, density, diversity and evenness. The multivariate taxonomic and functional structure of assemblages changed significantly according to canopy availability in terms of taxa and functional groups abundance, but no substantial change was observed in composition. Biogenic habitat simplification resulted in a decrease in total invertebrate abundance and in taxonomic and functional density and diversity, whilst no effects were observed in taxonomic and functional evenness. Loss of canopy involved an impoverishment of the whole community particularly for epiphytic colonial sessile suspension-feeders, but it also extended to non-epiphytic forms. Our results emphasize the importance of canopy decline as a major driver of changes in benthic ecosystem properties and highlight that biogenic space provided by canopy is a limiting resource for the development of rocky subtidal invertebrates. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;2017;2023-07-04 07:35:14;2024-03-25 08:32:21;;123-133;;;130;;J.

However, the number and accuracy of community level metrics to measure the success of these strategies are limited. Using intertidal shellfish reefs as a model, we tested to what extent foundation species alter community and food web structure, and explored whether basic metrics of food web structure are useful indicators of ecosystem complexity compared to other often-used indices. We found that shellfish reefs strongly modified community and food web structure by modifying habitat conditions (e.g. hydrodynamics, sediment grain size). Stable isotope-based food web reconstruction captured important differences between communities from bare mudflat and shellfish reefs that did not emerge from classic abundance or diversity measures. On shellfish reefs, link density and the number of top predators were consistently higher, while both connectance and the richness of intermediate species was lower. Species richness (+ 42%), species density (+ 79%) and total biomass of benthos, fish and birds (+ 41%) was also higher on shellfish reefs, but this did not affect the Shannon diversity or Evenness. Hence, our results showed that basic food web metrics such as link density and number of top consumers and intermediate species combined with traditional measures of species richness can provide a robust tool to measure conservation and restoration success. We therefore suggest that these metrics are included as Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV), and implemented as ecosystem health indicators in legislative frameworks such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd;2017;2023-07-04 07:35:17;2024-01-30 13:02:21;;317-324;;;213;;Biol.

We assessed coral reefs, mangrove fringes, and seagrass meadows on the Caribbean coast of Panama to explore the influences of their proximity to one another, habitat cover, and environmental characteristics in sustaining biomass, species richness and trophic structure of fish communities in a degraded tropical ecosystem. We found 94% of all fish across all habitat types were of small body size (≤10 cm), with communities dominated by fishes that usually live in habitats of low complexity, such as Pomacentridae (damselfishes) and Gobiidae (gobies). Total fish biomass was very low, with the trend of small fishes from low trophic levels over-represented, and top predators under-represented, relative to coral reefs elsewhere in the Caribbean. For example, herbivorous fishes comprised 27% of total fish biomass in Panama relative to 10% in the wider Caribbean, and the small parrotfish Scarus iseri comprised 72% of the parrotfish biomass. Wefound evidence that non-coral biogenic habitats support reef-associated fish communities. In particular, the abundance of sponges on a given reef and proximity of mangroves were found to be important positive correlates of reef fish species richness, biomass, abundance and trophic structure. Our study indicates that a diverse fish community can persist on degraded coral reefs, and that the availability and arrangement within the seascape of other habitat-forming organisms, including sponges and mangroves, is critical to the maintenance of functional processes in such ecosystems. © 2018 Seemann et al.;2018;2023-07-04 07:35:18;2024-01-24 13:31:45;;;;3;2018;;PeerJ;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Foundation species; seagrass; habitat; species richness; fish; mangrove; Caribbean; predator; body size; degradation; biomass; coral reef; Nursery habitat; Sponges; Overfishing; nursery; trophic level; Habitat connectivity; Reef degradation; Trophic imbalance; human; nonhuman; article; seashore; Panama; COASTAL; CONSERVATION; DEGRADATION; PHASE-SHIFTS; SEAGRASS BEDS; COVER; ASSOCIATIONS; BOCAS-DEL-TORO; REGION-WIDE DECLINES; MARINE NURSERIES; ⭐; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The most widespread reef building species along Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts is S. alveolata (L.), while the aggregations of S. spinulosa are typically limited to the North Sea coasts. This paper constitutes the first detailed description of unusual large S. spinulosa reefs in the Mediterranean Sea. Defining current health status and evaluating the most important threats and impacts is essential to address conservation needs and design management plans for these large biogenic structures. Present knowledge on Mediterranean reefs of S. alveolata is fragmentary compared to Northeast Atlantic reefs, and concerning S. spinulosa, this paper represents a focal point in the knowledge on Mediterranean reefs of this species. A one-year study on temporal changes in reef structure and associated fauna is reported. The annual cycle of S. spinulosa reef shows a spawning event in winter-early spring, a period of growth and tubes aggregation from spring-early summer to autumn and a degeneration phase in winter. The variations exhibited in density of the worm aggregation and the changes in the reef elevation highlight a decline and regeneration of the structure over a year. The many ecological roles of the S. spinulosa reef were mainly in providing a diversity of microhabitats hosting hard and sandy bottom species, sheltering rare species, and producing biogenic structures able to provide coastal protection. The Mediterranean S. spinulosa reef does not shelter a distinctive associated fauna; however the richness in species composition underscores the importance of the reef as a biodiversity hot-spot. Finally, the roles of the biogenic formations and their important biotic and physical dynamics support the adoption of strategies for conservation of Mediterranean S.spinulosa reefs, according to the aims of the Habitat Directive. © 2017";2018;2023-07-04 07:35:19;2024-01-29 08:55:16;;248-257;;;200;;Estuar.

This variation may in turn affect species interactions among members of the attendant community. We describe a habitat-provisioning species that, with variation in a simple trait, produces dichotomous classes of habitat: one that serves as a predation refuge and the other that does not. Subtidal roots of the Caribbean red mangrove Rhizophora mangle are colonized by a diverse epibiont assemblage that includes many species of sponge. We experimentally demonstrated that roots touching the seafloor give benthic sea star predators access to their sponge prey living on the roots. After 6 wk, half of sponges on grounded roots were eaten, whereas sponges on suspended roots were uneaten. Correspondingly, in concomitant field surveys of mangrove root epibiont as semblages, we found very different sponge ensembles on the 2 root types. Even after standardizing for root area, suspended roots harbored 7 sponge species that covered an average of 91.3% of subtidal root length, while grounded roots, where sponges were exposed to sea star predation, had only 4 sponge species that covered 63.2% of root length. There was little overlap in species composition and a single sponge species Chondrilla caribensis, that was never eaten in our experiment, dominated grounded roots. This study suggests that a simple, dynamic trait of mangrove roots-groundedness-controls predator access, with consequences for assemblage composition. © Inter-Research 2017.;2017;2023-07-04 07:35:20;2024-01-30 07:43:39;;15-23;;;573;;Mar.

This is of concern because habitats created by bioengineering species support and enhance local biodiversity. The present study investigated the abundance and distribution of polychaetes among distinct patches of the biogenic habitats created by the tubeworm Galeolaria caespitosa, the Sydney rock oyster Saccostrea glomerata and the turfing red alga Corallina officinalis on natural rocky shores within Sydney Harbour, NSW, Australia. Assemblages of polychaetes were compared among the habitats, species of polychaetes restricted to single habitats were identified (1 species was unique to oysters or Galeolaria, and 7 species were unique to coralline turf), estimates of their contribution to diversity at the patch and landscape scale, and unique species were made. The relative cover of each of the habitats throughout Sydney Harbour is patchy but within the marine dominated sections of natural rocky shores, they are widespread. All habitats supported unique species of polychaetes and overall assemblages differed among the habitats. Loss of biogenic habitats due to climate change, harvesting or other anthropogenic activities, will result in loss of many species of polychaetes and will have larger scale implications. Future management of marine biodiversity, including the potential for a marine park network in Sydney Harbour, needs to take into account the importance of biogenic habitats in supporting these diverse assemblages of invertebrates. © 2018 Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales.;2017;2023-07-04 07:35:26;2024-01-30 12:51:46;;194-206;;2;39;;Aust.

Tropical mangroves are proliferating at the intersection with temperate saltmarshes and continue moving poleward with unknown consequences for inhabitant marine fauna. We expected that mangrove and marsh foundation species differ in habitat quality, due at least in part to differences in their structural attributes, such that shifts from marsh to mangrove wetlands alter habitat availability for wetland inhabi -Tants. We coupled recruitment surveys and laboratory experiments to assess the influences of foundation species' structural and non-structural attributes on Callinectes spp. recruitment, preference, and survival among mangrove and marsh habitats. Re - cruitment was evident in Spartina alterniflora and Rhizophora mangle intertidal habitats but not in Avicennia germinans. In laboratory trials, S. alterniflora was preferred in the presence of predation risk and provided the highest probabilities of survival, indi - cating that settlers can distinguish among ecotone vegetation types and that their choices correspond to habitat quality. Survival probability and recruit persistence were comparatively low in mangrove habitats. The differences in habitat use, preference, and survival identified in this study suggest that mangrove expansion is diminishing wetland habitat for Callinectes spp. It also reveals that changes between habitat-forming species, and not just the loss of structure per se, can affect habitat quality, such that foundation species may not replace one another functionally where they displace each other spatially. © Inter-Research 2017.;2017;2023-07-04 07:35:28;2024-07-16 14:06:55;;1-14;;;573;;Mar.

Examinations of samples taken from dense, continuous mussel beds at seven stations along the coast of northern Levantine Sea yielded 187 macro-benthic invertebrate species belonging to 11 taxonomic groups. Polychaeta accounted for 46% and 37% of the total number of species and individuals, respectively. The top three dominant species in the mussel beds were Stenothoe gallensis, Spirobranchus kraussi and Mytilaster minimus. The species with the highest frequency values on the mussel beds were Pseudonereis anomala, Phascolosoma stephensoni and Elasmopus pocillimanus. The highest density and biomass of the associated fauna were estimated as 42,550 ind m-2 and 1503 wwt g m-2, respectively. The species number in samples varied between 14 and 47 species. The environmental variables best explaining variations in zoobenthic community structures were salinity, dissolved oxygen and total inorganic nitrogen in the water column. The biotic indices, TUBI and ALEX, classified the ecological status of one or two stations as moderate or poor, based on the relative abundances of ecological and zoogeographic groups, respectively. A total of 21 alien species were found to be associated with the mussel bed, of which Syllis ergeni is being newly considered as a new established alien species for the Mediterranean Sea.

The recruitment phase is crucial for organisms with a bentho-pelagic life cycle, such as bivalves, and it regulates the population renewal success. This study provides new insight on the role of temperate benthic habitats on bivalve recruitment, as a function of nursery areas. Six dominant benthic habitats of the Chausey archipelago (Normandy, France) were studied. In each habitat, bivalve recruit assemblages were described at the end of two reproductive seasons. Furthermore, Ostrea edulis juveniles were immerged on each habitat during two months to compare growth performances and feeding status, estimated by fatty acid composition. Recruit assemblages differ from each habitat according to sediment grain-size composition and bathymetrical levels. Subtidal habitats, and especially Crepidula fornicata banks and Glycymeris glycymeris coarse sands, supported the highest species abundance and richness of recruits. All O. edulis juveniles fed on the same trophic resources but digestive glands of juveniles from C. fornicata banks were more concentrated in total fatty acids than those from subtidal G. glycymeris coarse sands and maerl banks. Our results depict the key role of subtidal and structured habitats, composed of ecosystem engineers, in enhancing bivalve recruitment and extending the bivalve population renewal. This study suggests that the crucial role of these habitats as bivalve nurseries must be integrated in management perspectives. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;2017;2023-07-04 07:35:31;2024-03-25 08:56:02;;11-23;;;121;;J.

A study in Atlantic Canada showed that, at low elevations where conditions are benign due to the brief low tides, fucoid algal canopies (Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus spp.) do not affect the structure of benthic communities. However, at middle and high elevations, where low tides last longer, fucoid canopies limit abiotic extremes and increase the richness (number of invertebrate and algal species, except fucoids) of benthic communities. Using the data from that study, this paper compares the intensity of facilitation and its importance (relative to all other sources of variation in richness) between middle and high elevations, which represent intermediate and high stress, respectively. Facilitation intensity was calculated as the percent increase in benthic richness between quadrats with low and high canopy cover, while the importance of facilitation was calculated as the percentage of variation in richness explained by canopy cover. Data for 689 quadrats spanning 350 km of coastline were used. Both the intensity and importance of facilitation were greater at middle elevations than at high elevations. As canopies do not affect benthic communities at low elevations, this study suggests that the facilitation-stress relationship at the community level is unimodal for this marine system. Such a pattern was found for some terrestrial systems dominated by canopy-forming plants.

The achievement of this goal is potentially hindered by the lack of essential empirical data, especially in the Mediterranean Sea. This study addresses some of the current knowledge gaps by quantifying and comparing multi-scale patterns of abundance and distribution of two habitat-forming species (Sabellaria alveolata and S. spinulosa) and their associated fauna along 190 km of coast on the Italian side of the Sicily Channel. While the abundance of the two sabellariids and the total number of associated taxa did not differ at any of the examined scales (from tens of centimetres to tens-100 of kilometres), the structure (composition in terms of both the identity and the relative abundance of constituting taxa) of the associated fauna and the abundance of several taxa (the polychaetes Eulalia ornata, Syllis pulvinata, S. garciai, Nereis splendida and Arabella iricolor, and the amphipods Apolochus neapolitanus, Tethylembos viguieri and Caprella acanthifera) varied among locations established ∼50–100 km apart. Syllis pulvinata also showed significant variation between sites (hundreds of metres apart), analogously to the other syllid polychaetes S. armillaris and S. gracilis, the nereidid polychaete Nereis rava, and the amphipod Gammaropsis ulrici. The largest variance of S. spinulosa, of the structure of the whole associated fauna and of 56% of taxa analysed individually occurred at the scale of replicates (metres apart), while that of the dominant bio-constructor S. alveolata and of 25% of taxa occurred at the scale of sites. The remaining 19% and the total richness of taxa showed the largest variance at the scale of locations. Present findings contribute to meet a crucial requirement of any future effective protection strategy, i.e., identifying relevant scales of variation to be included in protection schemes aiming at preserving representative samples not only of target habitats and organisms, but also of the processes driving such variability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd;2017;2023-07-04 07:35:34;2024-03-25 08:36:23;;325-337;;;130;;Mar.

The aims of the present study are to characterize macro- and meiobenthic communities in a Caribbean coral reef and to analyze the effects of habitat type on the α-, β-, and γ-diversity of free-living nematodes. Two reef sites with four habitat types each were selected: seagrass bed, bare sand, coral rubble, and algal turf. Habitats within sites were adjacent to each other and characterized by their physical architecture, hydrodynamic regime, and foundation species. The diversity of marine communities was high, with eight phyla represented in the macrobenthos and 18 phyla in the meiobenthos. The structure of macrobenthos was strongly associated with the habitat type. This relationship was weaker for meiobenthos, which is likely related to ecological drift, hydrodynamic regime, and macrobenthic influence. The nematode species richness was high at both studied scales: α-diversity ranged from 31 to 83 species per habitat and γ-diversity for the whole reef was 156 ± 4 species. The nematode assemblages consisted of few dominant and many rare species, which is typical of hyperdiverse faunas. The β-diversity was large in the reef with few shared species and the presence of distinctive nematode assemblages adapted to the physical architecture and food availability of each habitat. The results imply that the physical structure and heterogeneity of the coral reef habitats are important for maintaining the high diversity of small invertebrates, especially regarding the richness and turnover of nematode species. © 2016, Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;2017;2023-07-04 07:35:34;2024-01-30 08:13:13;;101-111;;1;47;;Mar.

To test this, we quantified the positive effects of mussel beds on associated benthic communities around the entire South African coastline (~3500 km). We hypothesised that molluscan assemblages would show stronger affinities to the presence of mussel beds with increasing levels of heat-stress. Biomimetic loggers used to characterise thermal properties within and outside mussel beds found that solitary mussels experienced significantly greater daily maximum temperatures than mussels within beds across all locations. However, the magnitude of such differences did not appear to vary with latitude or time of year but rather was strongly influenced by biogeographic region. Differences in the abundance, diversity and community structure of molluscs within and outside mussel beds showed similar biogeographic variability, with differences in total molluscan abundances being most pronounced along the cool temperate west coast during summer and least pronounced along the warm temperate south coast during winter. Greater affinity of molluscan assemblages for mussel beds within cooler biogeographic regions suggests that evolutionary history and/or other abiotic factors may be the primary cause for the stronger influence of mussel beds on the west coast. This highlights the complex, context-dependant nature of ecosystem engineering and the varying degrees to which associated organisms affiliate with these biogenic structures. Such findings have important implications for the use of ecosystem engineers as umbrella species in ecological conservation. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.;2017;2023-07-04 07:35:35;2024-01-30 08:17:59;;568-582;;3;20;;Ecosystems;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"ecosystem engineers; ecosystem engineering; rocky shore; environmental stress; community structure; Mollusca; mussel beds; coast; South Africa; biogeography; body temperatures; intertidal environment; Mytilus galloprovincialis; Perna perna; mollusc assemblages; rocky intertidal shore; thermal stress; body temperature; mollusc; temperature effect; biogeographical region; COMMUNITIES; IMPACTS; PATTERNS; BIODIVERSITY; ORGANISMS; COAST; ASSEMBLAGES; STRESS; GRADIENTS; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Along the southern coasts of Alaska, in particular, two species of canopy-forming kelps with dissimilar morphologies, Nereocystis luetkeana and Eualaria fistulosa, co-occur but vary in their distributions and patterns of abundance, with one species often replacing the other at given sites in subsequent years. As a result, their differences in morphology may affect patterns of current flow through the forests, which could have strong impacts on invertebrate settlement and benthic diversity, particularly in Kachemak Bay, Alaska (59° 36′33ʺN, 151° 20′51ʺW), which experiences large tidal fluctuations resulting in strong alongshore currents. In this study, significant differences in current reductions were observed between the two kelp forest types within Kachemak Bay, but these reductions were small compared to the natural spatiotemporal variability of currents within the bay, and they were primarily limited to the upper few meters of the water column where the two species exhibit their greatest differences in morphology. Consequently, invertebrate settlement and abundance differed between the two kelp forest types as well as among study sites within the bay. In addition, there were differences observed in the composition and abundance of understory algae between the two forest types, which were presumably due to differences in shading abilities of the dominant kelps. Together, our results suggest that future changes in the distribution and abundances of these two kelp forest types may result in corresponding changes in hydrodynamic conditions within the forests, and thereby impact invertebrate and benthic algal assemblages. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;2017;2023-07-04 07:35:37;2024-01-30 08:28:54;;;;4;164;;Mar.

At patch scales, effects of ecosystem engineers on associated communities can range from positive to negative according to how the ecosystem engineer modifies environmental conditions. In a metaanalysis of 68 empirical studies, we assessed how, for a widespread group of ecosystem engineers- the marine habitat-forming bivalves-bivalve taxon, density, habitat, tidal elevation and latitude, as well as habit, or lifestyle, of associated taxa, influences the magnitude and direction of their effect on associated invertebrates. Overall, marine bivalves had a positive effect on both species abundance and species density, but effect sizes varied considerably according to bivalve traits and environmental setting. Oysters enhanced invertebrate abundance to a greater extent than either mussels or pinnids, perhaps because of the greater habitat heterogeneity they provide. Nevertheless, the effect of mussels on associated communities was generally more responsive to spatial variation in engineer traits and environmental context than the effect of oysters or pinnids. Positive effects of mussels on associated species abundance decreased at high mussel densities, were greater at subtidal than mid-low intertidal elevations and differed among faunal habits depending on habitat setting. Knowledge of those conditions under which positive effects of bivalves on associated biodiversity is greatest will help in identifying which species of ecosystem engineer, at which sites, should be prioritised for conservation and restoration, where the goal is enhancement of biodiversity. © Inter-Research 2017.;2017;2023-07-04 07:35:37;2024-03-25 08:43:18;;95-110;;;563;;Mar.

Future alterations in communities and ecosystems may be precipitated by changes in the abundance of strongly interacting species, whose disappearance can lead to profound changes in abundance of other species, including an increase in extinction rate for some. Nearshore coastal communities are often dependent on the habitat and food resources provided by foundational plant (e.g., kelp) and animal (e.g., shellfish) species. We quantified changes in the abundance of the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis), a foundation species known to influence diversity and productivity of intertidal habitats, over the past 40 years in the Gulf of Maine, USA, one of the fastest warming regions in the global ocean. Using consistent survey methods, we compared contemporary population sizes to historical data from sites spanning >400 km. The results of these comparisons showed that blue mussels have declined in the Gulf of Maine by >60% (range: 29–100%) at the site level since the earliest benchmarks in the 1970s. At the same time as mussels declined, community composition shifted: at the four sites with historical community data, the sessile community became increasingly algal dominated. Contemporary (2013–2014) surveys across 20 sites showed that sessile species richness was positively correlated to mussel abundance in mid to high intertidal zones. These results suggest that declines in a critical foundation species may have already impacted the intertidal community. To inform future conservation efforts, we provide a database of historical and contemporary baselines of mussel population abundance and dynamics in the Gulf of Maine. Our results underscore the importance of anticipating not only changes in diversity but also changes in the abundance and identity of component species, as strong interactors like foundation species have the potential to drive cascading community shifts. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd;2017;2023-07-04 07:35:39;2024-01-29 15:00:29;;341-352;;1;23;;Global Change Biol.;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Biodiversity; Animals; Ecosystem; foundation species; Population Dynamics; biodiversity; population dynamics; mussel; ecosystem; abundance; algae; Mytilus edulis; population biology; Atlantic; community ecology; Gulf of Maine; global change; community composition; historical ecology; Maine; benchmarks; mollusc; population density; Atlantic Ocean; animal; population decline; Population Density; Animalia; benchmarking; PATTERNS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MYTILUS-EDULIS L.; GULF; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; RANGE; BLUE MUSSELS; FOOD; ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURES; MAINE; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Here we tested the influence of gorgonian colonies on sedimentation rates and vagile fauna trends, comparing sediments collected by traps inside and outside a gorgonian garden, in a coralligenous community of the Western Ligurian Sea, at 32 m depth, over a period of 1 year. The results indicated that sea fans created a sort of homeostatic effect on the surrounding habitat. We found evidence that where gorgonian colonies were present, the monthly fluctuations of sediments rate were lower than outside a garden. Gorgonian colonies also influenced the distribution of the associated vagile fauna; these organisms were generally more abundant inside than outside the garden.

Corals are widely recognized foundation species that create reef habitats that are hotspots for biodiversity. However, the impact of global reef degradation on overall patterns of biodiversity remains difficult to predict because of our limited knowledge of mechanistic relationships between reef structure and community composition. We examined the resilience of invertebrate abundance and biodiversity on reefs following a recent coral mass mortality event on the Caribbean coast of Panama. First, we surveyed mobile invertebrate communities at both healthy and degraded reef sites and found that dead coral habitats support invertebrate assemblages that can be more diverse and abundant than live coral habitats and that coral habitat (whether live or dead) in turn supports higher diversity and abundance than structurally simple sand areas without coral. Second, we experimentally tested mechanisms of reef habitat suitability for invertebrate colonization by manipulating coral mortality and structural complexity. We found that the abundance and species richness of mobile invertebrates were significantly affected by substrate complexity rather than whether coral was live or dead. However, we detected shifts in species identity between live and dead coral. Moreover, the sensitivity of the community to reef structural complexity indicates that the ability of degraded coral reefs to sustain invertebrate assemblages is unlikely to persist if declines in reef complexity outpace recovery of living corals to the reef. Our findings suggest that the biodiversity-sustaining function of reefs has the potential to persist following coral disturbance at the scale of entire reefs and that some metrics of community structure are therefore resilient to events of foundation species mortality. © 2016 Nelson et al.;2016;2023-07-04 07:35:43;2024-03-25 12:50:43;;;;7;7;;Ecosphere;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Biodiversity; foundation species; Coral reefs; Foundation species; Habitat complexity; ecosystem engineer; biodiversity; habitat complexity; Ecosystem engineer; habitat degradation; Habitat degradation; coral reefs; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DEGRADATION; FISH; PHASE-SHIFTS; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; TROPHIC CASCADE; SCALE; SEAGRASS; EXTINCTION; HABITAT COMPLEXITY; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this study, habitat preference (macroalgal host preference) and temporal changes (season) of epifaunal communities associated to five macroalgal species such as Padina, Sargassum, Ulva, Acanthophora and Gracilaria were observed at seasonal intervals (summer and winter) for 2 years from May 2012 to March 2014 on the Jeddah coastal waters of the Red Sea. Major epifaunal groups observed included polychaetes, amphipods, isopods, gastropods, mussels and crabs. Polychaetes were represented by 10 species followed by amphipods with five species. The abundance of gastropods, polychaetes and mussels showed significant variation between the macroalgae irrespective of morphology. Generally, the abundance of these taxa were high on Padina and low on Sargassum. Significant seasonal changes were observed on the abundance of polychaetes, amphipods and isopods. The abundance of some epifaunal groups showed a significant relationship with environmental parameters such as surface water temperature, salinity, pH and dissolved oxygen content. © Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom 2015.;2016;2023-07-04 07:35:46;2024-03-25 13:32:43;;1457-1467;;7;96;;J.

For example, kelp holdfasts form intricate structures and host the largest number of organisms in kelp ecosystems. However, methods that quantify 3D habitat complexity have only seldom been used in marine habitats, and never in kelp holdfast communities. This study investigated the role of kelp holdfasts (Laminaria hyperborea) in supporting benthic faunal biodiversity. Computer-aided tomography (CT-) scanning was used to quantify the three-dimensional geometrical complexity of holdfasts, including volume, surface area and surface fractal dimension (FD). Additionally, the number of haptera, number of haptera per unit of volume, and age of kelps were estimated. These measurements were compared to faunal biodiversity and community structure, using partial least-squares regression and multivariate ordination. Holdfast volume explained most of the variance observed in biodiversity indices, however all other complexity measures also strongly contributed to the variance observed. Multivariate ordinations further revealed that surface area and haptera per unit of volume accounted for the patterns observed in faunal community structure. Using 3D image analysis, this study makes a strong contribution to elucidate quantitative mechanisms underlying the observed relationship between biodiversity and habitat complexity. Furthermore, the potential of CT-scanning as an ecological tool is demonstrated, and a methodology for its use in future similar studies is established. Such spatially resolved imager analysis could help identify structurally complex areas as biodiversity hotspots, and may support the prioritization of areas for conservation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.;2016;2023-07-04 07:35:46;2024-04-17 14:58:19;;47-56;;;477;;J.

Stratified into several microhabitats, kelp forests represent one of the most complex biotopes in coastal waters. These microhabitats are generally made of biogenic structures characterised by species-specific life cycles and their complexity is expected to change over time. In a Laminaria hyperborea forest near Roscoff (Brittany, France), we tested whether temporal changes differed among strata (lamina, stipe, holdfast and rock) in terms of habitat complexity, richness and species abundance distributions. At the scale of the study, the epiphytic habitat was relatively stable over four sampling dates, whereas epilithic structures of the understorey appeared particularly unstable in terms of habitat size and distribution among morpho-functional groups of habitat-formers. Unlike sessile species, mobile fauna experienced substantial temporal changes in richness and abundance distribution in all microhabitats studied. Although mobile fauna distribution varies in part with habitat complexity, additional factors likely come into play such as seasonal and stochastic variation in direct and indirect food resources. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.;2016;2023-07-04 07:35:47;2024-03-25 13:13:16;;33-54;;1;777;;Hydrobiologia;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Sediments; Biodiversity; Biomass; Kelp; kelp forest; biodiversity; species richness; abundance; complexity; brown alga; biogenic structure; biomass; Seasonality; Laminaria hyperborea; microhabitat; France; seasonality; temporal variation; Microhabitats; relative abundance; seasonal variation; aquatic environment; coastal water; sessile species; Bretagne; population distribution; Finistere; Roscoff; LAMINARIA-HYPERBOREA; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITY; FAUNA; BIOLOGY; CANOPY; HETEROGENEITY; TROPHIC STRUCTURE; MARINE-INVERTEBRATES; ALGAL SUCCESSION; Biomass Kelp; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Here we explore how declining pH and carbonate saturation may affect the structural complexity of four major biogenic habitats. Our analyses predict that indirect effects driven by OA on habitat-forming organisms could lead to lower species diversity in coral reefs, mussel beds and some macroalgal habitats, but increases in seagrass and other macroalgal habitats. Available in situ data support the prediction of decreased biodiversity in coral reefs, but not the prediction of seagrass bed gains. Thus, OA-driven habitat loss may exacerbate the direct negative effects of OA on coastal biodiversity; however, we lack evidence of the predicted biodiversity increase in systems where habitat-forming species could benefit from acidification. Overall, a combination of direct effects and community-mediated indirect effects will drive changes in the extent and structural complexity of biogenic habitat, which will have important ecosystem effects. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Living beds of rhodoliths create carbonate-based biogenic benthic habitats, which are sensitive to human disturbance and slow to recover. Despite their ecological importance, few quantitative assessments of the distribution and anthropogenic impacts on rhodoliths exist for the eastern Pacific Ocean. Following historical reports of beds in the Channel Islands off California, USA, we mapped bed distributions, examined rhodolith habitat sensitivity to human disturbance, and determined seasonal growth rates to assess rhodolith recovery potential at Santa Catalina Island. Rhodolith material from 7 beds covering 23000 m2 of live rhodoliths and 43000 m2 of dead rhodolith sediment were mapped. Beds were patchy, dominated by small Lithothamnion australe rhodoliths (mean ± SD: 10.6 ± 0.8 mm in diameter), and 6 beds were disturbed by mooring arrays. Surveys of mooring frequency and experimental manipulation of mooring chains showed that the cover of live rhodoliths, their physical structure, and the diversity and abundance of associated benthic species were negatively related to this prevalent anthropogenic disturbance. Axial growth rates of Santa Catalina Island rhodoliths were relatively slow, seasonally variable, and similar to those reported in other rhodolith studies (annual mean: 1.25 ± 0.62 mm yr-1). Due to their importance as biogenic habitat, sensitivity to disturbance, and slow recovery potential, California rhodolith beds should be considered a priority for monitoring efforts and restoration and should be included within marine protected area planning. © Inter-Research 2016.;2016;2023-07-04 07:35:51;2024-03-25 12:29:09;;135-145;;;560;;Mar.

We aimed to understand the role of ecosystem engineering species in suboptimal habitats from a population inhabiting the species range margin in naturally stressful conditions. We determined the impact of 2-4 cm sized patches of dwarfed mussels Mytilus trossulus close to its lower salinity limit in the North-Eastern Baltic Sea, on epibenthic community patterns. Mussels affected total macrofaunal abundance and biomass and the taxonomic and functional community structure based on abundances, as well as the species composition of macrofauna. Mussels did not affect ephemeral algae or sediment chlorophyll content, but increased the abundance, biomass, richness, and diversity of grazers, within a radius approximately twelve times the size of mussel patches. We can expect marginal populations of ecosystem engineers in suboptimal habitats to contribute to spatial heterogeneity in biotic patterns and eventual ecosystem stability. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.;2016;2023-07-04 07:35:52;2024-03-25 13:20:30;;10-17;;;116;;Mar.

In Europe, the most extensive reef formation is located in the Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel (France). Since 2006, Sabellaria bio-constructions have developed on hard substrates along the west coast of the Cotentin Peninsula between Champeaux and Saint-Germain-sur-Ay on the northern part of the Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel. In this sector, two distinct types of bio-construction can be distinguished: platforms and reefs. The aim of this study is to analyse the patterns of the associated macrofauna on these platforms and reefs, as well as outside, and test for a correlation between the presence of Sabellaria bio-constructions and the richness of the benthic macrofauna. Univariate analyses are used to compare the macrofauna on four sites (Champeaux, Lingreville, Blainville-sur-Mer and Saint-Germain-sur-Ay). The results show a higher taxonomic richness on the platform-type than on the reef-type structures, and also a higher taxonomic richness outside the bio-construction areas. This suggests that, on the examined sites, the presence of S. alveolata bio-constructions does not contribute to higher levels of benthic macrofaunal richness on hard substrates. Temporary bio-constructions along this coast exhibit reefs of interest at some sites as well as in very small zones which merit special attention. © 2016 The Author(s).;2016;2023-07-04 07:35:52;2024-03-25 12:43:25;;;;1;5;;SpringerPlus;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel; FAUNA; BAY; POLYCHAETA; COLONIES; Cotentin coast; Macrofauna taxonomic richness; Sabellaria reefs; Temporary reefs; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, their importance has not been well noted in biogeographic studies. Macrofaunal assemblages associated with subtidal beds of the ribbed mussel (Aulacomya atra) along South America were studied to assess the relationship between their diversity patterns and the proposed biogeographic provinces in the Southeastern Pacific and Southwestern Atlantic Oceans. Samples from ribbed mussel beds were obtained from 10 sites distributed from the Peruvian coast (17ï¿½S) to the Argentinean coast (41ï¿½S). The sampling included eight beds in the Pacific and two in the Atlantic and the collections were carried out using five 0.04ï¿½m2 quadrants per site. Faunal assemblages were assessed through classification analyses using binary and log-transformed abundance data. Variation in the size and density of mussels, and in the species richness, abundance and structure of their faunal assemblages were tested using a permutational multivariate analysis of variance. Faunal assemblages showed a north–south latitudinal gradient along both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. Binary and abundance data showed a difference in the resulting clustering arrangement of Pacific sites between 40ï¿½S and 44ï¿½S, indicating a pattern of continuity in the species distribution associated with biological substrates. At a regional scale, the distribution of species along the South American coast matched the general provincial pattern shown by prior studies, which show two biogeographic units on the Pacific coast separated by an intermediate (probably transitional) zone and a single province on the Atlantic coast extending up to Northern Argentina. Biological substrates such as ribbed mussel beds play an important ecological role by making a similar habitat type available on a large scale for a variety of invertebrate species. Despite such habitat homogeneity, however, the associated fauna exhibit marked distribution breaks, suggesting strong constraints on dispersal. This therefore suggests that macrofaunal assemblages could possibly be used as biogeographic indicators. ï¿½ 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH;2016;2023-07-04 07:35:53;2024-03-25 12:33:58;;943-956;;5;37;;Mar.

Rockweed plant structure varies regionally, and several morphotypes have been identified in Atlantic Canada alone. Yet the regionality of canopy structure, associated species communities and the link between the two have not been well understood. Using large-scale field surveys and multivariate statistical approaches, we report distinct canopy structures between sites in southwest Nova Scotia and southwest New Brunswick, the two major rockweed harvesting areas in Atlantic Canada, as well as distinct associated community composition. We then demonstrate significant links between canopy and community structure. Importantly, plant and canopy structure, including length, circumference and density, were much better predictors of associated community structure than rockweed biomass, which is often used for single-species monitoring. Adding region or site as predictors further improved model fits. Therefore, measuring plant or canopy structure would strongly improve insight regarding ecosystem changes. Moreover, incorporating information about regional differences in canopy structure and the dependence of associated communities on those canopies is critical for spatially refined, ecosystem-based management of the rockweed harvest. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;2016;2023-07-04 07:35:54;2024-03-25 13:25:12;;;;12;163;;Mar.

In this study the associated macrofauna of the massive/tubular ecosystem-engineering sponges Agelas oroides and Aplysina aerophoba was studied across distinct ecological zones of two eastern Mediterranean caves. Our results revealed that the examined sponges supported a considerable associated macrofauna. A total of 86 associated taxa were found, including species reported for the first time as sponge symbionts and typical cave dwellers. Crustaceans predominated in terms of abundance but polychaetes showed the highest number of taxa. A clear differentiation was observed in the structure of the associated assemblage between the two sponges, attributed not only to the sponge species but also to differences in the surrounding environment. Density, diversity and the trophic structure of the sponge-associated macrofauna did not vary significantly along the horizontal axis of the surveyed caves. These findings suggest that sponges form a quite stable habitat, maintaining their functional role as ecosystem engineers across the studied marine caves and increasing habitat complexity in the impoverished inner dark cave sectors. © 2016 CSIC.;2016;2023-07-04 07:35:57;2024-03-25 13:27:34;;279-289;;3;80;;Sci.

Here, we address these research gaps. We first quantified distributions of the seaweed host Hormosira banksii and its obligate epiphyte Notheia anomala at different tidal elevations in summer and winter at Kaikoura, New Zealand. This analysis showed that the host and the epiphyte were, in both seasons, most abundant at 'high' and 'low' tidal elevations respectively, probably driven by contrasting responses to competitors and desiccation. We subsequently quantified richness and abundances of mobile invertebrates associated with Hormosira and various levels of epiphytic Notheia. Hormosira fronds were collected from different elevations, seasons, diurnal cycles, with different neighbouring algae and following an epiphyte-removal experiment. All tests showed positive density-dependent effects of Notheia-epiphytism on richness and abundances of invertebrates, with strongest facilitation occurring at the transition from intertidal to subtidal habitats. Our results support a growing number of facilitation cascade studies from different ecosystems and habitats, and suggest that habitat formation-driven facilitation cascades may be particularly common in marine benthic systems where epibiosis can be a dominant life form. © CSIRO 2016.;2016;2023-07-04 07:36:01;2024-03-25 12:31:06;;144-152;;;67;;;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"facilitation; ecosystem engineering; foundation species; biodiversity; coexistence; benthos; abundance; algae; New Zealand; invertebrates; intertidal environment; density dependence; invertebrate; epibiosis; epiphyte; alga; Hormosira banksii; host specificity; biofouling; habitat cascade; coexisting ecosystem engineers; quantitative analysis; Invertebrata; removal experiment; South Island; Marlborough; Hormosira; pioneer species; Kaikoura; Notheia; Notheia anomala; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; NEW-ZEALAND; INVERTEBRATES; HORMOSIRA-BANKSII; MOBILE EPIFAUNA; ASSEMBLAGES; MACROALGAE; SEAGRASS BED; EPIPHYTES; NOTHEIA-ANOMALA; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In Chesapeake Bay. USA, warming is likely to favor the more heat and stress-tolerant Ruppia maritima (widgeongrass) over Zostera marina (eelgrass). Because of the key role of seagrasses in providing habitat and trophic support, it is important to determine whether the more stress-tolerant seagrass provides similar ecological functions to the species it may replace. We addressed how trophic control differs between communities associated with the 2 seagrass species in a mesocosm experiment. Grazing of epiphytic algae can benefit seagrasses over competing algae, and crustacean mesograzers are an important link for higher trophic levels. We manipulated seagrass density, species identity, and presence of grazers and predators, and examined the resulting communities of recruiting algae and invertebrates. Overall, predation was higher in Ruppia than in Zostera, although mesograzer species individually differed in their susceptibility to predation and response to seagrass species. The presence of grazers and predators had a greater overall effect on multivariate metrics of fouling community development than did seagrass species identity. Initial densities of seagrass and grazer species had interactive effects on some recruiting microalgae and tunicates. Differences in grazer composition and predation between seagrass species could have consequences for higher trophic levels that rely on fauna in seagrass beds. However, given the considerable effects of manipulated seagrass and mesograzer density on trophic interactions and the fouling community, it may be most important to consider the overall density and distribution of seagrass present, rather than seagrass species identity. Our results highlight the importance of testing redundancy in ecological functions among habitat-forming species. © The authors 2016.;2016;2023-07-04 07:36:03;2024-03-25 12:59:19;;105-121;;;556;;Mar.

The dominant habitat-forming macroalga Phyllospora comosa (Fucales) went locally extinct along the metropolitan coastline of Sydney in the 1980s. However, the consequences of that disappearance to the associated faunal diversity in these habitats, and whether Phyllospora is ecologically redundant with respect to the biodiversity it supports, are not known. Efforts are underway to restore Phyllospora, and the capacity to enhance local biodiversity is an important component of the rationale for restoration. We compared epifaunal diversity (abundances and composition) between Phyllospora and two other co-occurring habitat-forming algae, the kelp Ecklonia radiata and the fucoid Sargassum vestitum, and determined whether Phyllospora transplanted to Sydney developed different epifaunal communities than undisturbed thalli and controls. Where the 3 species naturally co-occurred, Phyllospora supported different abundances of taxa than Ecklonia and Sargassum, as well as different composition at finer scales, which suggests that this species is not completely redundant and that its disappearance may have affected local biodiversity. Similarly, assemblages on transplanted Phyllospora differed from those on Ecklonia and Sargassum at restored sites, but did not always resemble assemblages from extant natural Phyllospora populations, even 18 months after transplantation. These experiments indicate that restoration of key habitat-forming seaweeds not only recovers the algal species but also reduces risks of losing habitat diversity for epifauna and their consumers.

Although much descriptive work supports their importance, there remains little definitive information on the mechanisms by which foundation species alter their environment. These mechanisms fall into two basic categories: provision of food or other materials, and modification of the physical environment. Here, we manipulated the abundance of a marine foundation species, the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, in 40 × 40-m plots at Mohawk Reef off Santa Barbara, California and found that its biomass had a strong positive effect on the abundance of bottom-dwelling sessile invertebrates. We examined the carbon (C) stable isotope values of seven species of sessile invertebrates in the treatment plots to test the hypothesis that this positive effect resulted from a nutritional supplement of small suspended particles of kelp detritus, as many studies have posited. We found no evidence from stable isotope analyses to support the hypothesis that kelp detritus is an important food source for sessile suspension-feeding invertebrates. The isotope composition of invertebrates varied with species and season, but was not affected by kelp biomass, with the exception of two species: the tunicate Styela montereyensis, which exhibited a slight enrichment in C stable isotope composition with increasing kelp biomass, and the hydroid Aglaophenia sp., which showed the opposite effect. These results suggest that modification of the physical habitat, rather than nutritional subsidy by kelp detritus, likely accounts for increased abundance of sessile invertebrates within giant kelp forests. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;2015;2023-07-04 07:36:05;2024-04-08 07:35:30;;1199-1209;;4;179;;Oecologia;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Ecosystem engineers; Biomass; Animals; Ecosystem; Kelp; kelp forest; Invertebrates; ecosystem; abundance; carbon; ecosystem dynamics; physiology; Macroalgae; kelp; Macrocystis pyrifera; brown alga; environment; diet; United States; Stable isotopes; biomass; invertebrate; metabolism; detritus; trophic structure; California; stable isotope; Sessile invertebrates; Carbon; Macrocystis; Detritus; Diet; isotopic composition; Environment; animal; sessile species; feeding behavior; filter feeder; Invertebrata; growth, development and aging; Carbon Isotopes; Feeding Behavior; Santa Barbara [California]; Hydroida; metazoan; food supplementation; Aglaophenia; Mohawk Reef; Styela montereyensis; FOREST; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; SEA-URCHINS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; TOP-DOWN; BENTHIC SUSPENSION FEEDERS; FOOD-WEB; PHYTOPLANKTON; PARTICULATE ORGANIC-MATTER; SUBMARINE-CANYON; discu; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A major threat to the stability of these ecosystems is the proliferation of non-native species, such as the Japanese kelp Undariapinnatifida (‘Wakame’), which has recently colonised natural habitats in the UK. We quantified the abundance and biomass of U. pinnatifida on a natural rocky reef habitat over 10 months to make comparisons with three native canopy-forming brown algae (Laminaria ochroleuca, Saccharina latissima, and Saccorhiza polyschides). We also examined the biogenic habitat structure provided by, and epibiotic assemblages associated with, U. pinnatifida in comparison to native macroalgae. Surveys conducted within the Plymouth Sound Special Area of Conservation indicated that U. pinnatifida is now a dominant and conspicuous member of kelp-dominated communities on natural substrata. Crucially, U. pinnatifida supported a structurally dissimilar and less diverse epibiotic assemblage than the native perennial kelp species. However, U. pinnatifida-associated assemblages were similar to those associated with Saccorhiza polyschides, which has a similar life history and growth strategy. Our results suggest that a shift towards U. pinnatifida dominated reefs could result in impoverished epibiotic assemblages and lower local biodiversity, although this could be offset, to some extent, by the climate-driven proliferation of L. ochroleuca at the poleward range edge, which provides complex biogenic habitat and harbours relatively high biodiversity. Clearly, greater understanding of the long-term dynamics and competitive interactions between these habitat-forming species is needed to accurately predict future biodiversity patterns. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.;2016;2023-07-04 07:36:06;2024-03-25 13:39:57;;661-676;;3;18;;Biol.

Recently, the presence of C. fluminea was associated with changes in benthic and epibenthic fauna. In this study, we aimed to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of C. fluminea on an estuarine macrozoobenthic assemblage using a manipulative experiment. We used 5 different treatments (control, rock, closed, live, open), which were placed in a low sandy intertidal soft bottom area in the Minho estuary (NW Iberian Peninsula) for 2 months. We found that the presence of live and open empty shells of C. fluminea had positive effects on the density, biomass and species richness of macrozoobenthos, specifically on species belonging to Annelida, Mollusca and Crustacea. Our results may be explained by 2 main mechanisms: (1) the production of feces and pseudofeces by C. fluminea, which increases organic matter content and food resources for some macrozoobenthic species; and (2) ecosystem engineering activities by C. fluminea, which can create conditions for the establishment of other species via shell production and bioturbation in the sediments. © Inter-Research 2015.";2015;2023-07-04 07:36:09;2024-03-25 15:22:18;;157-167;;;522;;Mar.

The effect of this species on the richness, diversity and structure of epilithic intertidal community was assessed through an MBACI design in both sewage-impacted and reference sites, and Before/After the invasion. The presence of reefs of B. proboscidea since spring 2008 has caused a significant reduction of total individuals, total taxa and diversity in sewage-impacted sites regarding the reference ones. The species analyzed showed a high variable response because patterns were dominated by small-scale variability.

The structure of fish assemblages can vary with these characteristics and with the location of the assemblage within the forest, i.e. edges versus interiors. This study quantified the biological and physical heterogeneity within different sized kelp forests and identified which factors are important in structuring the associated fish assemblages. Fish and habitat surveys were conducted at the edge and interiors of ten kelp forests of varying sizes in Kachemak Bay, south-central Alaska. Fish assemblage structure was not correlated with the species composition of surface canopy forming foundation kelps (Nereocystis leutkeana and Eualaria fistulosa) or with kelp forest size. Instead, it correlated with the abundances of two understory foundation kelps (Agarum clathratum and Saccharina latissima), substratum rugosity, and water depth. Together these benthic attributes explained 53.6 % of the fish assemblage variability. Additionally, significantly different fish assemblages were found at edge compared to interior locations with the relative abundance of seven species (Artedius fenestralis, Ammodytes hexapterus, Blepsias cirrhosis, Gadus macrocephalus, Hexagrammos stelleri, Pholis laeta, and Sebastes melanops) explaining 91.4 % of the variability. This study highlights the importance of habitat characteristics such as understory foundation species, substratum rugosity, water depth and location within a patch on the variability of fish assemblages in high latitude kelp forests. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.;2014;2023-07-04 07:36:13;2024-04-08 13:28:02;;1253-1263;;11;97;;Environ.

However, many species interactions are context dependent, where the outcome or strength of the interaction depends on the biotic or abiotic conditions. Therefore, a mechanistic knowledge of species interactions, especially those involving foundation species, may allow for a more complete understanding of how anthropogenic changes influence nearshore ecosystems. This study describes the interaction between the seagrass Thalassia testudinum and the sponge Halichondria melanadocia, a species that grows around the base of seagrass shoots. A combination of surveys and experimental manipulations on Abaco Island, The Bahamas, revealed that the interaction between T. testudinum and H. melanadocia is a commensal relationship with the sponge benefiting from the presence of T. testudinum up to medium shoot densities (589-615 shoots per m2). The net neutral effect of H. melanadocia on T. testudinum is likely a balance of the negative effect of the sponge shading the seagrass with the positive effect of nitrogen and phosphorus supplied by the sponge. The mechanisms underlying the interaction between H. melanadocia and T. testudinum suggest that the interaction is likely context dependent. As such, environmental change, namely eutrophication, has the potential to shift the nature of this interaction from commensal to parasitic. A simple simulation showed that if this relationship becomes parasitic, above ground production in seagrass beds could be reduced. This study highlights the importance of a mechanistic understanding of species interactions involving foundation species when predicting human impact on the environment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.;2015;2023-07-04 07:36:15;2024-04-17 15:15:00;;33-40;;;465;;J.

Although there is concern over the negative effects imposed by introduced species, positive effects are also possible. Introduced species may facilitate local resident species by providing or modifying habitat; these positive effects are sometimes overlooked, but are important for decisions about the local management of non-native species. The introduction of Zostera japonica to the Northeast Pacific coast is a case of a non-native foundation species that appears to expand total eelgrass habitat area, potentially facilitating local eelgrass-inhabiting species. In this study, we asked whether the non-native Z. japonica provides habitat for eelgrass-dwelling invertebrates that is similar to its native congener, Z. marina. We systematically quantified invertebrate assemblages in the two eelgrass species and quantified eelgrass characteristics that are relevant to epifaunal habitat quality (e.g. shoot density and surface area). We found that Z. japonica supports a greater total abundance of the same invertebrate species found in Z. marina meadows; however, the relative abundance of invertebrate species differed between Z. japonica and Z. marina. This result is consistent with differences in the two congeners’ morphological characteristics, density of vegetative and reproductive shoots, and total blade surface area per square metre. We conclude that the expansion of total eelgrass habitat due to the introduction of Z. japonica appears to increase the available habitat for local epifaunal invertebrate communities. © 2015, Taylor & Francis.";2015;2023-07-04 07:36:18;2024-04-08 07:49:09;;564-571;;6;11;;Mar.

In other areas, ascidians have been reported to play the role of ecosystem engineers, as they support a significant number of epibionts, increasing benthic diversity. In this study, a total of 21 sessile macroepibiotic taxa present on the ascidian species Corella antarctica Sluiter, 1905, Cnemidocarpa verrucosa (Lesson, 1830) and Molgula pedunculata Herdman, 1881 were identified, with Bryozoa being the most diverse. There were differences between the three ascidian species in terms of richness, percent cover and diversity of sessile macro-epibionts. The morphological characteristics of the tunic surface, the available area for colonization (and its relation with the age of the basibiont individuals) and the pH of the ascidian tunic seem to explain the observed differences. Recent environmental changes in the study area (increase of suspended particulate matter caused by glaciers retreat) have been related to observed shifts in the benthic community structure, negatively affecting the abundance and distribution of the studied ascidian species. Considering the diversity of sessile macro-epibionts found on these species, the impact of environmental shifts may be greater than that estimated so far. © 2015 C.

With the introduction of the Pacific oyster, a new biogenic structure has been added to subtidal sediment habitats in Scandinavia. By conducting a field experiment, the effects of live and post-mortem shell structures of C. gigas and M. edulis on associated infauna, epibenthic fauna and fish on the Swedish west coast were evaluated. Plots with 5 different treatments (live Pacific oysters, oyster shells, live blue mussels, mussel shells and sand control) were constructed on bare sandy sediment at 2 subtidal localities. Epibenthic macrofauna and fish were sampled with a drop trap, and sediment and infauna samples were collected with sediment cores. Live bivalve treatments had significant effects on organic content of the sediment; however, no treatment effects on infauna were found. In contrast, abundance and biomass of epibenthic fauna increased 4 to 8 times and species richness increased in the presence of the bivalves or their shells, compared to the sand control. Epibenthic fauna abundance and biomass was higher in the oyster shell treatment compared to the live bivalve treatments, which in turn had higher abundance and biomass than the mussel shell treatment. In general, the mussel shell treatment favoured small crustaceans, while the oyster shell and live bivalve treatments favoured fish and larger invertebrate species. Based on these results, we conclude that further establishment of the Pacific oyster in Swedish waters will cause large changes to community structure of benthic macrofauna and fish. © Inter-Research 2015.";2015;2023-07-04 07:36:18;2024-03-25 16:04:07;;123-138;;;518;;Mar.

High densities of the habitat building annelid Lanice conchilega also increase local biodiversity. This study describes the benthic biodiversity of a rocky reef and its surrounding sand bottom with dense L. conchilega beds in the Borkum Reef Grounds, north of the island of Schiermonnikoog in the Dutch North Sea. A side-scan sonar survey revealed distinct seabed areas with high acoustic reflections, indicating the presence of hard substrate on the sandy seafloor. To ground truth the side-scan sonar data and make an inventory of the biodiversity of the observed habitats, a multi-method sampling approach (box corer, SCUBA airlift sampler and visual transects, drop-down camera) was used. This revealed (1) rocky reefs: a combination of gravel, stones and rocks; (2) individual rocks in a sandy environment; (3) sand with dense L. conchilega beds (>1500ind·m-2) and (4) sand bottom habitat. A total of 193 taxa were found with many unique species per habitat. Species richness was significantly higher on sand when compared to the rocky reef (NB-GLM; p=0.006), caused by the presence of dense L. conchilega beds (Poisson GLM; p<0.001). Including dense L. conchilega beds as an additional habitat showed that these held a higher species richness than the rocky reefs (NB-GLM; p=0.002), while sand without dense L. conchilega beds did not (NB-GLM; p=0.14). Since the rocky reefs were present on a sandy bottom, the local biodiversity more than doubled with the presence of rocky reefs. The nMDS plot clearly separated the sand and rocky reef communities and also showed a clustering of dense L. conchilega beds within the sand samples. Each method detected unique species, demonstrating the value of a multi-method approach compared to e.g. box coring alone. This study identified several species previously unknown to the Borkum Reefs Grounds area. The total area of rocky reefs in the southern part of the Dutch Borkum Reef area is estimated to be 9.8km2 and of L. conchilega beds with densities >1500ind·m-2 to be 74km2.

Different types of benthic ecosystem engineers have been suggested to facilitate different communities in otherwise similar marine environments, partly because they alter sediment conditions in contrasting ways. However, most studies testing this hypothesis have either not manipulated the presence of engineers, or have transplanted engineers into areas already dominated by other engineers, which limits the ability to assess the relative engineering effects. Here we combined a field survey and a field experiment to investigate if two contrasting ecosystem engineers - the sediment-stabilizing seagrass Zostera noltei and the bioturbating lugworm Arenicola marina - facilitate different macrofauna communities. The study was performed in a sheltered mudflat area of the eastern Dutch Wadden Sea, where seagrasses and lugworms form a mosaic of spatially alternating seagrass-dominated elevations (hummocks) and lugworm-dominated depressions (hollows). Results showed that seagrasses facilitated some organisms (mainly attached epifauna) while lugworms facilitated others (primarily burrowing infauna), generating distinctly different macrofauna communities in hummocks and hollows. However, seagrasses had a much stronger effect on the macrofauna communities than lugworms, and competitively excluded lugworms. This contrasts with results from similar studies in hydrodynamically more exposed sand flats, where lugworms instead dominate communities and exclude seagrass. We therefore propose that effects of ecosystem engineering (acting primarily on a local scale) and variation in abiotic conditions (acting on larger scales, e.g., hydrodynamic gradients along the Dutch coastline) strongly interact to dictate the distribution and fitness of engineering species, and indirectly, the diversity and structure of associated benthic communities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.;2015;2023-07-04 07:36:19;2024-04-08 08:06:20;;56-65;;;97;;J.

We investigated the effects of losing this foundation species on habitat provisioning for benthic epifauna, macroinfauna, and meiofauna in these distinct geographical regions. In GA, significant shifts in invertebrate community assemblages were observed between bare and reference (vegetated) plots, with abundances of all invertebrate groups and the diversity of macroinfauna lower in bare plots. In LA, community assemblages overlapped considerably in dieback and reference plots. Although epifaunal snails were significantly decreased in dieback plots, meiofauna were unexpectedly increased. Other invertebrates did not differ between plots. Supplemental transplanted plots allowed for direct evaluation of stem density effects on invertebrates. Stem density predicted abundances of all invertebrate groups in GA, and was positively correlated with increased soil moisture. In LA, elevation and soil moisture were good predictors of infauna but were not related to stem density. Differences between the states suggest that S.alterniflora may not provide equivalent ecosystem services in all salt marshes. Additional disturbances (drought, GA; hurricanes, LA) decreased infaunal density and taxon richness in 2008. However, in both states the reduction of macroinfauna was larger in bare than reference areas, suggesting that vegetation protected against further disturbance. Our results suggest that the role of S.alterniflora is context-dependent both in terms of geographic setting and the specific ecosystem service under consideration. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.";2015;2023-07-04 07:36:19;2024-07-16 15:24:39;;218-230;;PB;163;;Estuar.

Intertidal Spartina species are well known for modifying tidal hydrodynamic and sediment processes, affecting cohabiting infaunal organisms. The stout razor clam Tagelus plebeius is an infaunal filter-feeding species that inhabits a broad range of mudflats (MF) and Spartina saltmarshes (SM) along the American Atlantic coast. Through descriptive and experimental approaches conducted at the Bahía Blanca estuary (Argentina, 38°47'S, 62° 20'W), we evaluated ecosystem engineer effects of Spartina alterniflora (due to changes in sediment and water characteristics) on somatic and shell growth of T. plebeius. Comparison of bulk sediment parameters indicated that the sediment is more easily eroded in the SM than in the MF, but softer in the latest. In addition, food supply for clams (i.e., total particulate organic matter) was higher in the MF although food quality (i.e., percentage of organic matter in the water column) was in general higher in SM. Shell growth was higher but clam condition index (CI) was lower in the MF, and the opposite pattern was found in the SM. These results represent an uncoupling between shell and somatic growth with a positive effect of S. alterniflora on the CI of clams. Nevertheless, results of field experiments manipulating stems and roots of plants separately suggested that the effect of Spartina on clam's CI was not due to the structural changes generated by plant presence itself, although a better food quality in the SM may be related to the larger clams CI. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.;2015;2023-07-04 07:36:19;2024-07-16 15:34:14;;135-142;;;463;;J.

In temperate systems, seaweeds are a main habitat former and support extremely diverse communities, including many economically important species. Coastal urbanisation is, however, causing significant declines of key habitat-forming seaweeds. To develop successful management strategies such as seaweed habitat restoration, it is necessary to first determine what additional ecosystem values are likely to be added through restoration and to provide baseline data against which goals can be established and success can be measured. The habitat-forming fucoid Phyllospora comosa was once common on shallow subtidal reefs around Sydney, Australia’s largest city, but disappeared in the 1980s, coincident with heavy sewage outfall discharges. To provide the baseline data necessary for restoring and managing Phyllospora in areas from where it has disappeared, we quantified the community composition and abundance of fish and large invertebrates (abalone and sea urchins) in healthy Phyllospora habitats and compared them to those in Ecklonia radiata (the other major habitat-forming kelp in the region) as well as other common shallow subtidal habitats. Fish assemblage structure was similar between Phyllospora vs Ecklonia beds, but Phyllospora supported much greater numbers of abalone and urchins than any other habitat. This suggests that, in terms of some components of the biodiversity it supports, Phyllospora is functionally unique and not a redundant species. Restoring this seaweed will, therefore, also contribute to biodiversity rehabilitation by restoring unique faunal assemblages that are supported by Phyllospora, including economically important species. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.;2014;2023-07-04 07:36:27;2024-04-08 13:19:52;;1089-1096;;2;26;;J.

The positive impacts of seagrass vegetation on zoobenthic abundance and diversity (as compared to bare sands) are well documented, but only in surveys performed in summer, which is the season of maximum canopy development. Here we present the results of the first study of the relationship between the seasonal variability of seagrass vegetation and persistence and magnitude of contrasts in faunal communities between vegetated and bare sediments. The composition, abundance, biomass, and diversity of macrozoobenthos in both habitats were compared five times throughout the year in temperate eelgrass meadows in the southern Baltic Sea. Significant positive effects of macrophyte cover on invertebrate density and biomass were recorded only in June, July, and October when the seagrass canopy was relatively well developed. The effects of vegetation cover on faunal species richness, diversity, and composition persisted throughout the year, but the magnitude of these effects varied seasonally and followed changes in macrophyte biomass. The strongest effects were observed in July and coincided with maximums in seagrass biomass and the diversity and biomass of other macrophytes. These observations indicate that in temperate, clearly seasonal systems the assessment of macrophyte impact cannot be based solely on observations performed in just one season, especially when that season is the one in which macrophyte growth is at its maximum. The widely held belief that macrophyte cover strongly influences benthic fauna in marine coastal habitats, which is based on summer surveys, should be revisited and complemented with information obtained in other seasons. © 2014 Włodarska-Kowalczuk et al.;2014;2023-07-04 07:36:27;2024-04-08 09:08:18;;;;7;9;;PLoS ONE;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Biodiversity; macrofauna; seagrass; biodiversity; species richness; sediment; time; vegetation; canopy; sea; biomass; species diversity; Baltic Sea; macrobenthos; macrophyte; species composition; Angiosperms; angiosperm; seasonal variation; Seasons; season; population abundance; article; Oceans and Seas; Geologic Sediments; growth, development and aging; Time Factors; analysis of variance; Analysis of Variance; EELGRASS ZOSTERA-MARINA; POSIDONIA-OCEANICA; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; MYTILUS-EDULIS; RELATIVE IMPORTANCE; SPATIAL VARIATION; HABITAT COMPLEXITY; TROPHIC INTERACTIONS; SHOOT-DENSITY; SEDIMENT CHARACTERISTICS; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the northern parts of the Baltic, the Bothnian Sea, the new fucoid species Fucus radicans (Bergstro¨m et Kautsky) was recently described. This study compares the thallus complexity and size as well as quantified the abundance and biomass of epiphytic algae and invertebrate taxa of the two fucoid species F. radicans and Fucus vesiculosus L. from sympatric sites in the Bothnian Sea on the Swedish coast and around the Estonian island Saaremaa. We found that F. radicans was more complex than F. vesiculosus within the whole study range, but both species had a more complex thallus structure in the Bothnian Sea compared to Estonia. The complexity of host algae did not contribute to their associated flora and fauna taxon richness; instead, the size of thalli was a good proxy for associated communities. Specifically, on a biomass basis, F. vesiculosus displayed highest species richness and highest faunal abundance in the Bothnian Sea, whereas no such differences were found around Saaremaa, probably because both Fucus species had similar height around Saaremaa whereas F. vesiculosus grew much taller and larger in the Bothnian Sea. There were some unique associated macroalgal and invertebrate species that were found only on either of the fucoids, indicating the importance of separating them as species in surveys and monitoring. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.";2014;2023-07-04 07:36:28;2024-04-08 09:23:20;;187-193;;;149;;Estuar.

Importantly, these effects can occur simultaneously and in opposite directions, although how they contribute to the net outcomes for predator-prey interactions remain unexplored. Seagrasses often have positive effects on associated fauna because their structure directly reduces predator encounter rates. However, we identified a 'risky' behaviour (shallower burial) in an infaunal bivalve at a high seagrass cover - likely induced by non-structural abiotic change - suggesting positive effects may be outweighed by risky behaviours. We determined whether the physical structure of the seagrass interacted with burial behaviour of clams to determine the predation and non-predation mortality and whether these interactions were mediated by the cover of the seagrass. Surveys on an intertidal sand flat in Tasmania, Australia showed that the highest densities of a dominant bivalve, Katelysia scalarina, occurred at low (33%) seagrass cover, but the lowest densities and the highest proportion of unburied clams occurred at high (100%) cover. A field experiment manipulating burial depth, seagrass cover and predator access demonstrated that unburied clams suffered very high predation and non-predation mortality compared to buried clams (~4x higher), which outweighed any positive effects of the seagrass structure in reducing predator access. Being unburied also had non-lethal consequences with surviving unburied clams having a reduced tissue biomass compared to buried clams. In this system, predation was driven by the availability of prey when they undertake a risky behaviour (shallow burial). However, significant changes in behaviour may only occur once a threshold of habitat-former density is reached. In this instance, changes in behaviour were likely due to seagrass effects on sediment redox potential, which decreased significantly above 33% seagrass cover. Our findings demonstrate that the negative effects of a habitat-former on the behaviour of associated species, via alteration of non-structural abiotic conditions, can outweigh any positive effects provided by increasing habitat structure as is commonly reported for habitat-formers. © 2013 British Ecological Society.;2014;2023-07-04 07:36:29;2024-04-17 15:16:33;;388-396;;2;83;;J.

The effects of these ecosystem engineers can be both positive and negative but the mechanisms behind their effects are not well described. In this study we determined the relative importance of three main mechanisms by which invasive ecosystem engineers can facilitate native fauna. The engineer may provide new physical structure that reduces harsh abiotic conditions or gives refuge from predation (both engineering mechanisms), or provide a new profitable food resource (a trophic mechanism). The invasive seaweed Gracilaria vermiculophylla is a novel addition to estuarine intertidal mudflats of the southeastern United States. The epifaunal amphipod Gammarus mucronatus is up to 100 times more abundant on Gracilaria -invaded mudflats compared to uninvaded mudflats. Feeding assays, a survivorship experiment and stable isotope analysis demonstrated that Gammarus consumes little Gracilaria and cannot survive on Gracilaria alone. However, the structural engineering effects of Gracilaria greatly enhanced the survivorship of Gammarus in the presence of predators during high tide and when exposed to harsh abiotic conditions during low tide. Our results demonstrate that invasive ecosystem engineers can dramatically affect the distribution and abundance of native species by providing a novel protective structure. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.;2014;2023-07-04 07:36:30;2024-04-08 09:00:27;;2694-2698;;10;95;;Ecology;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"facilitation; ecosystem engineering; epifauna; habitat structure; seaweed; Spartina alterniflora; Ecosystem engineering; abundance; Facilitation; Amphipods; Gracilaria vermiculophylla; nonnative species; invasive species; survivorship; United States; feeding; Feeding; amphipod; Amphipoda; Nonnative species; mudflat; growth response; biotic factor; Gammarus mucronatus; COMMUNITIES; IMPACTS; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; DYNAMICS; AMPHIPODS; PREDATION; SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA; HERBIVORES; PLANT INVASIONS; ALGA GRACILARIA-VERMICULOPHYLLA; amphipods; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They form rigid structures of high-magnesium calcite and have a good fossil record. Here I show that rhodoliths are ecosystem engineers in a high Arctic environment that increase local biodiversity by providing habitat. Gouged by boring mussels, originally solid rhodoliths become hollow ecospheres intensely colonised by benthic organisms. In the examined shelf areas, biodiversity in rhodolith-bearing habitats is significantly greater than in habitats without rhodoliths and hollow rhodoliths yield a greater biodiversity than solid ones. This biodiversity, however, is threatened because hollow rhodoliths take a long time to form and are susceptible to global change and anthropogenic impacts such as trawl net fisheries that can destroy hollow rhodoliths. Rhodoliths and other forms of coralline red algae play a key role in a plurality of environments and need improved management and protection plans. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.;2014;2023-07-04 07:36:32;2024-04-08 09:21:46;;;;;4;;Sci.

This study tests the hypothesis that invertebrate assemblages from intertidal mussel beds differ between wave-sheltered and wave-exposed habitats. To this aim, we surveyed exposed and sheltered sites spanning 350 km of coastline in Nova Scotia, Canada. We identified all invertebrates and measured their abundance in replicate quadrats that were fully covered by mussels. In total, we found 50 invertebrate taxa living in these mussel beds. Multivariate analyses revealed that the composition of invertebrate assemblages differed significantly between both habitat types. Exposed habitats supported a greater species richness, and the species that mainly explained the compositional difference between both environments were more abundant in exposed ones. Assemblages were taxonomically dominated by arthropods, annelids, and molluscs and numerically dominated by tubificid oligochaetes regardless of exposure. Our results suggest that exposed habitats may favor the occurrence of filter-feeders, such as barnacles, and sheltered habitats the occurrence of predators, such as small crabs and sea stars, in intertidal mussel beds from the NW Atlantic coast. © 2014 Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;2014;2023-07-04 07:36:32;2024-04-08 14:01:00;;203-211;;2;44;;Mar.

Over a 16-week period, we manipulated the in situ diversity profile (richness, evenness, identity, and abundance) of the dominant HFS (Fucus distichus edentatus, F. vesiculosus, and Mytilus spp.) in order to define their role in both the establishment of associated species and community primary production. Contrary to expectation, no general change in HFS richness, evenness, abundance, or identity on associated species community establishment was observed. However, over the study period, the HFS diversity profile modified the structure within the trophic guilds, which may potentially affect further community functions. Also, our results showed that the low abundance of HFS had a negative impact on the primary productivity of the community. Our results suggest that HFS diversity profiles have a limited short-term role in our study habitat and may indicate that biological forcing in these intertidal communities is less important than environmental conditions. As such, there was an opportunistic establishment of species that ensured rapid colonization regardless of the absence, or the diversity profile, of facilitators such as HFS.

Species invasions produce changes at trophic level and diversity shifts by replacing native species with species of similar ecological niche. This study focused on the effects of macroalgal invasions on seagrass ecosystems. We conducted two - year bimonthly sampling of a pristine Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadow and dead matte colonized by three Caulerpa species bimonthly. The largest changes in faunal composition were found in meadows colonized by Caulerpa prolifera, where major differences in infaunal taxonomic distinctness were apparent. On the other hand, the infaunal community was quite similar between the two invasive Caulerpa species (Caulerpa taxifolia and Caulerpa racemosa). The isotopic niche based on the main trophic guilds established using stable isotope signatures at community level resulted in a highly compacted and 15N-enriched C.prolifera food web structure, indicating high overlap of food source utilization among faunal components, which is typical of degraded systems. Conversely, the P.oceanica ecosystem presented the most complex food web, while the influence of the 2 invasive species were similar. An attempt to reconstruct the food web at each vegetated habitat revealed high trophic linkages among the different trophic levels with a continuous transition among them by the various trophic guilds suggesting an adaptation response of the different organisms to the new habitat forming species. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.;2014;2023-07-04 07:36:39;2024-04-08 13:56:58;;12-22;;;142;;Estuar.

It is not known, however, to what extent their effects on biodiversity change as their cover increases, and how these effects may differ depending on the environmental context. Experimental plots with increasing cover of oysters were established within two estuaries in two different habitats commonly inhabited by C. gigas, (mussel-beds and mud-flats) and were sampled after 4 and 15 months. Within mud-flat habitats, macroscopic species living on or in the substratum increased in richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity and number of individuals with oyster cover. In mussel-bed habitats, however, these indices were unaffected by the cover of oysters except at one estuary after 15 months when species richness was significantly lower in plots with the greatest cover of oysters. Assemblage structure differed with oyster cover in mud-flats but not in mussel-beds, except at 100 % cover in one location and at one time. Within mud-flats at one location and time (of four total tests), assemblages became more homogenous with increasing cover of oysters leading to a significant decrease in β-diversity. These responses were primarily underpinned by the facilitation of several taxa including a grazing gastropod (Littorina littorea), an invasive barnacle (Austrominius modestus) and a primary producer (Fucus vesiculosus) with increasing cover of oysters. Although there were consistent positive effects of C. gigas on mud-flat biodiversity, effects were weak or negative at higher cover on mussel-beds. This highlights the need for the impacts of invasive species to be investigated at a range of invader abundances within different environmental contexts. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.;2014;2023-07-04 07:36:40;2024-07-29 13:03:29;;1145-1163;;5;16;;Biol.

Here we tested the hypothesis that reef-forming mussels (Mytilus edulis L.), a dominant intertidal ecosystem engineer in the Wadden Sea, promote abundances of the burrowing bivalve Cerastoderma edule L. (cockle) in neighboring habitats at relatively long distances coastward from mussel beds. Field surveys within and around three mussel beds showed a peak in cockle densities at 50-100 m toward the coast from the mussel bed, while cockle abundances elsewhere in the study area were very low. Field transplantation of cockles showed higher survival of young cockles (2-3 years old) and increased spat fall coastward of the mussel bed compared to within the bed and to areas without mussels, whereas growth decreased within and coastward of the mussel bed. Our measurements suggest that the observed spatial patterns in cockle numbers resulted from (1) inhibition effects by the mussels close to the beds due to preemptive algal depletion and deteriorated sediment conditions and (2) facilitation effects by the mussels farther away from the beds due to reduction of wave energy. Our results imply that these spatial, scale-dependent interactions between reef-forming ecosystem engineers and surrounding communities of sedentary benthic organisms can be an important determinant of the large-scale community structure in intertidal ecosystems. Understanding this interplay between neighboring communities of sedentary species is therefore essential for effective conservation and restoration of soft-bottom intertidal communities. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.;2013;2023-07-04 07:36:42;2024-04-10 08:39:00;;489-498;;2;94;;Ecology;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Community structure; Animals; Ecosystem; facilitation; competition; Bivalvia; sediment; ecosystem; abundance; Facilitation; physiology; algae; community structure; bivalve; Mytilus edulis; intertidal ecosystem; survival; sea; Competition; intertidal environment; Cerastoderma edule; spatial planning; Wadden Sea; North Sea; tsunami; Intertidal ecosystem; genetics; algal community; Atlantic Ocean; conservation management; animal; article; Cardiidae; cockle; reef formation; Oceans and Seas; Geologic Sediments; habitat availability; Netherlands; species difference; Species Specificity; Tidal Waves; Schiermonnikoog; Scale-dependent effect; Stress alleviation; surveying; The Netherlands; RECRUITMENT; SETTLEMENT; TIDAL FLAT; WADDEN SEA; SEDIMENT DYNAMICS; COCKLES CERASTODERMA-EDULE; CURRENT VELOCITY; PATTERN-FORMATION; scale-dependent effect; SCALE-DEPENDENT FEEDBACK; Schiermonnikoog, The Netherlands; SPATIAL-PATTERN; stress alleviation; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We show that B. australis greatly increases a limiting resource (attachment space) to a community of sessile organisms and estimate that a large part of the invaded estuary now contain ca. 50 times more sessile individuals associated with the invader than all native snails combined. We argue that native snails are unlikely to have been dramatically reduced by the invader, and we therefore suggest that the shell-attached sessile community, as a functional group, has benefitted significantly from this invasion.

This biotic response to habitat engineering may result in non-intuitive cascading interactions, potentially including feedbacks to the engineer. Such feedback mechanisms, either positive or negative, may be especially important for the maintenance of biogenic habitats and their community-wide facilitation. Here, we describe the complex interactions and feedbacks that link marine habitat-forming engineers, the reef-building corals, and a group of herbivores, the parrotfishes; the latter preventing the overgrowth of macroalgae, a major competitor of corals. Using density data of eight parrotfish species on a Caribbean reef, we first describe the form of the response of parrotfish abundance to increasing topographic complexity generated by coral growth. Topographic complexity enhanced parrotfish abundance by promoting habitat suitability, but the shape (linear vs asymptotic) and strength of this response varied across species and size. Parrotfish grazing intensity, estimated from data on abundance and species-, size- and life phase-specific grazing rates also increased with topographic complexity despite an increase in the surface area over which parrotfish graze. Depending on fish species, this functional response was found to be linear or asymptotic. Using a simple analytical model we then explored the effects of topographic complexity and fishing pressure on coral-algal competition, with particular emphasis on the implications of non-linearities in the intensity of grazing. Simulations demonstrate that fishing and habitat degradation impair the performance of grazing, but that an asymptotic response of grazing intensity to topographic complexity increases the ecological resilience of coral reefs. Parrotfish and corals are mutually beneficial by creating a loop of positive, indirect feedbacks that maintain their own structure and function: coral growth promotes habitat suitability for parrotfish, concordantly enhancing grazing intensity, which in turn facilitates coral growth by reducing competitive exclusion by macroalgae. We conclude that the resilience of biogenic habitats is enhanced by non-linear biotic responses to engineering and by the emergence of reciprocal facilitation linking habitat engineering and response organisms. © 2012 The Authors.

Consequently, modifications to the structure of benthic communities would be expected to be associated with seagrass decline. Since 2005, Zostera noltii seagrass beds in Arcachon Bay (France), the largest in Europe, have undergone a severe decline. Twelve stations distributed throughout the lagoon were sampled in 2002, and all were found to be densely planted at that time. Subsequently, the same stations were revisited in 2010 and seagrass cover had drastically decreased by that time. Based on benthic macrofauna, multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis identified four groups. Years were separated. In 2002, two groups were distinct in relation to the water body, since in 2010 separation between the two other groups was related to seagrass occurrence. When looking at community structure and dominant species there were moderate differences within and between years, independent of seagrass decline. Seagrass loss did not drastically modify the species composition as they were preserved in the remaining seagrass patches. However, there was a drop in macrofauna abundance in unvegetated muddy compared with abundance in the remaining seagrass areas. Epifauna was particularly affected by seagrass decline. Among biotic indicators based on macrofauna, multivariate indicator MISS (Macrobenthic Index in Sheltered Systems) was in agreement with the similarity of macrofauna structure among groups, while other tested indicators performed badly in relation to seagrass occurrence. However, no index detected seagrass loss, highlighting the necessity of maintaining a separate survey on seagrass cover. © 2013 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.;2013;2023-07-04 07:36:47;2024-04-10 08:42:55;;795-807;;4;36;;Estuar.

In the bay of Concarneau, we investigated the specific diversity (i.e. species richness and species composition) and the functional structure (using biological traits) of the macrofauna associated with this Haploops community as a comparison with several surrounding soft-sediment communities to determine the effect of this engineer species on ecosystem functions. We showed that the occurrence of Haploops tubes and individuals significantly modifies sediment features (e.g. change in sediment grain size, increase in C and N organic content) but also largely affect species diversity and benthic composition. The species richness was significantly higher in Haploops community but the species assemblage associated with Haploops habitat was very homogeneous compared to the neighboring habitats and unique with 33% of all species exclusively found in this community. Multivariate analysis (dbRDA) revealed that Haploops density was by far the factor explaining the variation in species composition of benthic communities. No differences in species diversity and assemblage were detected in relationship to Haploops density. A biological trait analysis performed on the whole ecosystem (Haploops included) revealed that Haploops largely dominates the functional structure of the Haploops community by its own functional traits. When performed on selected traits of the associated fauna only (Haploops excluded) the functional structure of the Haploops community was characterized by a greatly reduced proportion of small to medium long lived, sensitive to disturbance, free living or burrowing/tube-building filter-feeding species. H. nirae appears to be a bioengineer and a foundation species that largely modifies its hydro-sedimentary features, controlling diversity and abundances of associated species, and creating a complex set of positive and negative interactions so that a unique benthic assemblage is found in sediments they colonized. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.;2014;2023-07-04 07:36:48;2024-04-08 13:09:20;;413-427;;;85;;J.

Positive above ground and negative below ground impacts are reported, suggesting that habitat-forming invasive species may affect community components differently. Furthermore, such effects may vary depending on the density of the invader. We determined the responses of community components to different densities of the invasive green alga Caulerpa taxifolia in southeastern Australia. Initially we investigated differences in soft-sediment faunal communities (above and below ground) across a biomass gradient at two invaded sites. Caulerpa taxifolia biomass was positively associated with the composition and abundance of the epifaunal community, but negatively correlated with the abundance of infauna. To examine the response of common community members in more detail, we caged two species of mollusk (the infaunal bivalve, Anadara trapezia and the epifaunal gastropod, Batillaria australis) across the same biomass gradient to determine lethal and sublethal effects of C. taxifolia biomass on individuals. Survivorship of A. trapezia was low when C. taxifolia was above 300 g m-2. Negative sublethal effects were also density-dependent with A. trapezia tissue weight being lowest above this same C. taxifolia biomass. The proportion of B. australis surviving was unaffected by C. taxifolia biomass. However, the total number of live B. australis recovered in cages increased as C. taxifolia biomass increased, providing further evidence of positive density dependent effects (in line with the survey data) of C. taxifolia on epifauna. Finally, we removed C. taxifolia from plots of differing C. taxifolia biomass and followed community change for 5 months. Community change following C. taxifolia removal was also density dependent as recovery 5 months post-removal depended on the initial biomass of C. taxifolia, suggesting a lag in the recovery of communities due to residual environmental effects post-removal (i.e. hysteresis). We have shown that the effects of a habitat-forming invasive species are biomass dependent and also affect community components differently, suggesting that, globally, the impact of these types of invaders may be context dependent. © 2012 The Authors.

The presence of ecosystem engineers is known to have important impacts in coastal sediments. Lanice conchilega is a well-known marine ecosystem engineer of shallow soft bottom ecosystems, shaping the macrobenthic community and attracting flatfish. The present study examines the relation between juvenile flatfish and L. conchilega reefs through two experiments. In a field experiment in the Dutch part of the North Sea, the benthic habitat is evaluated by comparing relative differences in numbers of juvenile flatfish between ecosystem engineered habitats and adjacent bare sand (i.e. non-ecosystem engineered) habitats. The hypothetical shelter seeking behaviour was further examined using stomach content analyses. Results show that juvenile plaice Pleuronectes platessa was the dominant species within the tube worm habitat and the species selects specifically for this biogenic habitat. This selection was explained as feeding behaviour. In a complementary laboratory study, food was excluded and the shelter function of the ecosystem engineered habitat was investigated. This experiment quantifies the selection for this habitat by juveniles of the common sole Solea solea. Results from the flume experiment, manipulating the number of tube worms, show that distribution of sole was not random when current velocities are high. The selected habitat is the one with low density tube worm aggregations. Overall, we conclude that structuring benthos plays an important role for juvenile flatfish, both as refuge and as feeding ground. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.;2013;2023-07-04 07:36:52;2024-04-08 14:26:22;;70-76;;;84;;J.

The black-pygmy mussel Limnoperna securis is an invasive species that is spreading along the Galician coast (NW Spain). Its current distribution overlaps with the distribution of the commercial native mussel species Mytilus galloprovincialis, but only in the inner part of two southern Galician rias. Here, we analysed the assemblages associated with clumps of the two mussel species and evaluated if the invasive species increased complexity of habitat. To measure complexity of clumps we used a new method modified from the ""chain and tape"" method. Results showed that the identity of the mussel influenced macrofaunal assemblages, but not meiofauna. L.securis increased the complexity of clumps, and such complexity explained a high percentage of variability of macrofauna.

Given the increasing threat of loss and alteration of habitats due to pressures associated with humans, there is a need for ecologists to understand species' requirements for habitat and to predict changes to taxa under various future environmental conditions. This study tested hypotheses about the generality of patterns described for one species of marine intertidal turban snail for a different, yet closely-related species in subtidal habitats along the coast of New South Wales, Australia. These two closely-related species live in similar habitats, yet under quite different conditions, which provided an opportunity to investigate how similar types of habitats influence patterns of distribution, abundance and size-structure in intertidal versus subtidal environments. For each species, there were similar associations between biogenically structured habitat and densities. The intertidal species, Turbo undulates, were more abundant, with greater proportions of small individuals in habitats formed by the canopy-forming alga, Hormosira banksii, the solitary ascidian, Pyura stolonifera or the turfing red alga, Corallina officinalis compared to simple habitat (bare rock). Similarly, more Turbo torquatus were found in biogenically structured subtidal habitat, i.e. canopy-forming algae, Ecklonia radiata, mixed algal communities ('fringe'), or turfing red algae (Corallina officinalis and Amphiroa aniceps) than where habitat is simple (barrens). Small T. torquatus were more abundant in areas of turf and 'fringe', while large snails were more abundant in areas of kelp and barrens. These patterns were found at each location sampled (i.e. eight intertidal and two subtidal rocky reefs) and at all times of sampling, across each environment. This study highlighted the consistent influence of biogenically structured habitats on the distribution, abundance and size-structure of intertidal and subtidal turban snails and forms a basis for increasing the understanding of the potential underlying processes causing such patterns. © 2013 Amy F.;2013;2023-07-04 07:36:57;2024-04-08 14:23:13;;;;5;8;;PLoS ONE;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Animals; Ecosystem; Geography; habitat structure; population structure; species distribution; Australia; Ascidiacea; alga; species composition; population density; Hormosira banksii; red alga; marine environment; Environment; nonhuman; population abundance; controlled study; species habitat; population size; article; seashore; Seawater; Snails; New South Wales; Population Density; Amphiroa aniceps; corallina officinalis; intertidal rocky reef; marine snail; Pyura stolonifera; subtidal rocky reef; Turbo torquatus; Turbo undulatus; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There is, however, little understanding of this connection. In the present study, based on quantitative monitoring (1997-2011) of three mussel beds in a fjord-like White Sea bay, two hypotheses were tested: (1) mussel assemblages are temporally unstable and local population fluctuates cyclically as a result of negative adult-juvenile interactions; and (2) oscillations in mussel size-structure are correlated with changes in the associated community structure. A negative correlation found between the abundance of small (length < 21 mm) and large (length > 20 mm) mussels suggests that adult mussels indeed suppress recruitment. Such interaction implies an auto-oscillatory pattern of population dynamics, with Large- and Small-dominated stages temporally replacing each other. This cyclic pattern was clearly revealed for one mussel bed only, but long-term replacement of the Large-dominated stage by the Small-dominated stage was revealed for the other two assemblages also. In general, temporal variations of mussel populations were significantly correlated with the dynamics of the associated community, although several abundant taxa (Tubificoides benedii, Littorina saxatilis, Macoma balthica, and Gammaridae) were insensitive to mussel changes. In contrast, filamentous algae and mud snails Hydrobia ulvae tended to be more abundant during the Large-dominated stage, whereas polychaetes Dipolydora quadrilobata were most abundant during the Small-dominated stage. Several other abundant ""sensitive"" taxa were obviously dependent on algal bloom. Thus, mussel beds are unstable systems, whose dynamics are shaped not only by the ecosystem engineer but also by the associated community. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.";2013;2023-07-04 07:36:58;2024-04-08 14:28:57;;139-158;;1;706;;Hydrobiologia;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"ecosystem engineering; abundance; algae; bivalve; Mytilus edulis; polychaete; Canada; Mussel beds; population structure; White Sea; Polychaeta; Monitoring; Hydrobia ulvae; Newfoundland; biomonitoring; Macoma balthica; Community dynamics; algal bloom; Population dynamics; size structure; Gastropoda; Long-term changes; long-term change; snail; Newfoundland and Labrador; hypothesis testing; Gammaridae; DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA; LONG-TERM; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; WADDEN SEA; BENTHIC INVERTEBRATES; MYTILUS-EDULIS; DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS; SOFT-BOTTOM; SMALL INTERTIDAL ANIMALS; DRIFTING ALGAL MATS; Dipolydora quadrilobata; Littorina; Littorina saxatilis; Tubificoides benedii; White Bay; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We tested for density-dependent effects of the macroalga Gracilaria comosa on the seagrass Halophila ovalis and its associated invertebrates in a subtidal field experiment, in the Swan River estuary (in Perth, Western Australia). G. comosa had significant negative effects on H. ovalis, reducing leaf densities by 20 and 40% when exposed to 0.7 and 1.4kgalgalwetweightm -2, respectively. By contrast, seagrass-associated invertebrates were positively affected by Gracilaria; taxonomic richness and densities of dominant crustacean and mollusc species increased with algal addition. More specifically, densities of surface dwelling gastropods, that utilize a 2-dimensional habitat, were saturated at 0.7kgalgalwetweightm -2, whereas densities of interstitial isopods and amphipods, that utilize a 3-dimensional habitat, had highest densities at 1.4kgalgalwetweightm -2. A non-native ecosystem engineer, the bioturbating gastropod Batillaria australis, dominated the surface dwelling mollusc community, and this invader was strongly facilitated by algal additions, being 5 times more abundant under algal mats compared to control plots. If the Swan River becomes more nutrient polluted and subsequently more algal dominated, then this ubiquitous invader may proliferate further, with difficult-to-predict system-wide ecological and biogeochemical consequences. We conclude that, in our experiment, 'harmful algae' inhibited the seagrass itself but facilitated most seagrass-associated invertebrates. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.";2012;2023-07-04 07:36:59;2024-04-10 13:54:07;;74-80;;;16;;Harmful Algae;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Seagrass; Invasive species; Ecosystem engineer; Facilitation; algae; Batillaria australis; Crustacea; Mollusca; Western Australia; Amphipoda; Isopoda; Gastropoda; Drift algae; Habitat cascade; Resource addition; Gracilaria; Invertebrata; Halophila ovalis; ABUNDANCE; EELGRASS ZOSTERA-MARINA; ACCUMULATION; THALASSIA-TESTUDINUM; LIGHT; HABITAT-FORMATION; MATS; SULFIDE; DRIFT ALGAE; SEAGRASS HALOPHILA-OVALIS; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We examined the density dependencies of facilitation cascades, including how the density of a basal foundation species influences the density of secondary foundation species, and how the density of secondary foundation species influences community structure. The system in which we assessed density dependencies was a temperate mangrove forest in which pneumatophores trap the fucoid alga Hormosira banksii and provide substrate for the oyster, Saccostrea glomerata. The alga and oyster in turn determine benthic community structure. In the field, algal biomass was positively correlated with pneumatophore density. Oysters, by contrast, were highly over-dispersed and correlated with the presence/ absence of pneumatophores. Epifaunal abundance and species richness were positively correlated with algal and oyster abundance, but their effects were independent. The positive effect of pneumatophore density on epifauna was primarily an indirect effect of trapping more algae. Pneumatophores did not directly influence invertebrate communities. Experiments revealed that, at very low pneumatophore densities, algal retention was insufficient to facilitate epifauna above that found on pneumatophores alone. At higher densities, however, increasing the density of pneumatophores increased algal retention, and the density and diversity of associated invertebrates. Shading by the mangrove canopy reduced algal biomass but did not modify the density-dependent nature of the cascade. Our results extend facilitation theory by showing that the density of both basal and secondary foundation species can be critical in triggering facilitation cascades. Our study also reveals that, where foundation species cooccur, multiple, independent cascades may arise from a single basal facilitator. These findings enhance our understanding of the role of density-dependent facilitation cascades in community assembly. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.;2012;2023-07-04 07:37:00;2024-04-11 07:10:41;;1388-1401;;6;93;;Ecology;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Ecosystem engineers; Animals; Ecosystem; ecosystem engineers; facilitation; ecosystem engineering; epifauna; oyster; ecosystem; positive interactions; Oysters; mangrove; Facilitation; physiology; community structure; climate; brown alga; oysters; sea; biomass; density dependence; Positive interactions; Density dependence; Australia; alga; Avicennia marina; population density; Hormosira banksii; crustacean; Phaeophyta; Australian mangrove; Avicennia; Climate; animal; article; Oceans and Seas; Ostreidae; Population Density; hierarchical system; Hierarchical facilitation; Pneumatophores; Foundation or habitat-forming species; Trait mediation; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; COMPETITION; PHAEOPHYCEAE; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; ORGANIZATION; POSITIVE INTERACTIONS; ASSEMBLAGES; HABITAT MODIFICATION; BEMBICIUM-AURATUM; foundation or habitat-forming species; hierarchical facilitation; pneumatophores; trait mediation; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In Hong Kong, the upper intertidal zone is extremely stressful, especially in summer when organisms are emersed for long periods in hot desiccating conditions. As a result, many species migrate downshore between winter and summer to reduce these stressful conditions. The littorinids Echinolittorina malaccana and E. vidua, for example, are found on open rock surfaces high on the shore in winter but the majority migrate downshore in summer to the same tidal height as a common barnacle, Tetraclita japonica. In the laboratory, where environmental conditions could be controlled to approximate those occurring on the shore, we tested whether the downshore migration allowed littorinids to select barnacles as biogenic habitats to reduce stress and if this behaviour varied between seasons. In summer, littorinids demonstrated a strong active preference for the barnacles, which was not observed in the cool winter conditions, when animals were found on open rock surfaces even when barnacles were present. Littorinids, therefore, only actively select biogenic habitats during the summer in Hong Kong when they migrate downshore, suggesting that such habitats may play an important, temporal, role in mitigating environmental stress on tropical shores. © 2012 The Author(s).;2012;2023-07-04 07:37:01;2024-04-11 06:45:13;;2323-2332;;10;159;;Mar.

We assessed whether in south-eastern Australia the invasive Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, differs from the native Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, in the biogenic habitat that it provides to epibiotic communities. We also assessed how within a species (S. glomerata), genotype influences habitat provision. First, we conducted a field experiment in which we compared recruitment of epibiota to concrete plates with either C. gigas, wild-stock S. glomerata, selectively bred S. glomerata or glue (control). Second, we assessed whether within wild S. glomerata populations invaded by C. gigas, communities of epibenthos are correlated to the ratio of non-native to native oysters. On experimental plates C. gigas grew larger, and experienced higher mortality than both selectively-bred and wild-stock S. glomerata at each of two heights on the shore. The two genotypes of S. glomerata, by contrast, displayed similar rates of growth and mortality. The differing growth patterns among oyster types had not, however, translated to consistent differences in the composition of associated benthic communities by 12. months following establishment of experimental treatments. Within established wild oyster assemblages, C. gigas were typically much larger than on our experimental plates, and the non-native influenced the abundance of several epibiotic taxa, although not the identity of species present. Where impacts of C. gigas on the abundance of associated benthic species occurred, they were generally negative. Overall, our results indicate that while differences in the population size-structure of C. gigas and S. glomerata may be evident from small-scale experiments, the detection of flow-on effects to associated epibenthic communities may require approaches that incorporate much larger spatio-temporal scales. Nevertheless, the observation that wild C. gigas primarily influenced the abundance rather than the identity of associated epifauna suggests a certain degree of redundancy between the two species in their provision of habitat to epibiota. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.;2012;2023-07-04 07:37:03;2024-04-10 09:09:09;;16-25;;;420-421;;J.

The non-native seaweed Gracilaria vermiculophylla has proliferated on estuarine mudflats throughout the southeastern US, including areas (South Carolina and Georgia) that historically were extremely low in seaweed biomass. Quantitative field surveys across 150 km of high salinity estuaries revealed that the density of the native onuphid polychaete Diopatra cuprea and the aboveground height of its biogenic tubes, which Diopatra decorates with drifting debris and seaweed, positively influenced Gracilaria biomass. The abundance of Gracilaria epifauna, composed primarily of amphipods and small snails, increased with Gracilaria biomass at many locations in our field surveys. To examine whether epifauna were facilitated by Gracilaria we experimentally manipulated Gracilaria biomass in two locations. Consistent with the field surveys, we found that increasing Gracilaria biomass facilitated epifauna, particularly amphipods and snails. Epifaunal densities on Gracilaria were higher than on a biologically-inert structural mimic of Gracilaria (plastic aquarium alga), indicating that epifauna colonize Gracilaria because Gracilaria provisions both physical structure and a biological resource. We also quantified the seaweed's net rate of productivity and decomposition. Primary production of Gracilaria was variable, but massive in some areas (up to 200 % net biomass increase in 8 weeks). The seaweed rapidly degraded upon burial in silty sediments (79 % loss in mass within 10 days) and thus may represent an important new addition to detrital foodwebs. As a copious, novel source of primary production, detritus, and desirable habitat for epifauna, Gracilaria has the potential to transform southeastern US estuaries. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.;2012;2023-07-04 07:37:06;2024-04-11 07:08:56;;2587-2600;;12;14;;Biol.

In this study we tested the effect of Macrocystis forests on recruitment of benthic organisms within Management and Exploitation Areas for Benthic Resources (MEABR). We placed artificial Tuffy collectors to sample recruits in three MEABRs during three different seasons. In each MEABR we installed 60 Tuffy collectors inside the kelp forest and an additional 60 outside the forest. Eight groups of invertebrate recruits were found abundantly in the study areas. The most common recruits belonged to the Mytilidae family, as well as the gastropod Tegula spp., the crabs Taliepus spp. and Pilumnoides perlatus, the keyhole limpet Fissurella spp., the sea urchin Loxechinus albus, the ascidian Ciona intestinalis and polychaetes. The kelp forest effect interacts significantly with season and locality for all eight invertebrates, the a-posteriori HSD Tukey test shows a significantly higher recruitment under the kelp forest than outside for Fissurella spp., polychaetes, Ciona, Pilumnoides and the family Mytilidae. On the other hand, only the sea urchin Loxechinus albus presented a significantly higher recruitment outside the kelp forest. As Macrocystis forests favoured the recruitment of several invertebrates, conservation of kelp forests is important for maintaining invertebrate biodiversity and science-based benthic fisheries management plans for its exploitation are required. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.;2012;2023-07-04 07:37:08;2024-04-11 07:12:24;;855-864;;9;8;;Mar.

Control of grazer-plant interactions is bi-directional on northwestern European coasts: grazing by limpets structures populations of macroalgae, while macroalgae provide habitat and food for limpets. Scottish shores dominated by the macroalga Fucus vesiculosus support lower densities and larger sizes of limpets Patella vulgata than shores with less Fucus. These patterns may be due to differences in inter-size-class competitive interactions of limpets among shores with different covers of Fucus. To examine this model, densities of small and large limpets were manipulated in plots with and without Fucus. Amounts of biofilm were measured in each plot. The presence of Fucus increased survival but hindered growth of small (15 mm TL) limpets, which were negatively affected by the presence of large limpets (31 mm TL). In contrast, large limpets were not affected by the presence of Fucus or of small limpets. This suggests the occurrence of asymmetric inter-size-class competition, which was influenced by the presence of macroalgae.

However, little is known about how these shifts in habitat-forming species impact local ecosystems and fisheries. To better understand the effects of tropical Sargassum colonization on temperate coastal fishes, we investigated differences in the habitat use patterns of fishes in temperate and tropical Sargassum species beds over 2 seasons on the temperate coast of Japan. The tropical Sargassum species were characterized by lower thallus height and a shorter vegetative period compared with temperate species; the thalli of the former were absent during autumn and winter. Peak of recruitment of juvenile fishes matched the biomass peak of both algae from late spring to early summer. Moreover, assemblage structures and food habits of fishes as well as the density of commonly consumed invertebrates did not differ significantly between the temperate and tropical algal beds during these seasons, suggesting that the habitat function (living/refuge space and foraging availability) of tropical algae was similar to that of temperate algae for most fishes. However, although most fishes displayed low specificity to host algae, some species, including important fishery species, recruited only during the middle of winter, when tropical algae were unavailable. This suggests that declining temperate algae may negatively affect some fish populations and fisheries within the next few decades. © Inter-Research 2012.";2012;2023-07-04 07:37:12;2024-07-29 13:19:16;;209-220;;;464;;Mar.

A reduction in the dominance of a native habitat-forming macroalga due to the replacement by an introduced species can have adverse effects on the community. The non-native red alga Grateloupia turuturu, first reported in Rhode Island, USA in 1994, has since extended its southern range into eastern Long Island Sound. This large alga has the potential to impact coastal communities by altering the floristic composition important to associated flora and fauna. A comparison of algal and epifaunal assemblages was made during 2006 and 2007 between native and non-native algal communities dominated by either G. turuturu or the native, Chondrus crispus at two sites in Long Island Sound. We found that within Grateloupia-dominated habitat, there was a large decrease in overall macrophyte biomass as compared to native habitat. We also found that habitat dominated by the non-native alga reduced species richness and total abundance of invertebrates relative to nearby habitats dominated by C. crispus. In addition, we found that the dominant mesofaunal species, important to higher trophic level consumers, had greatly reduced densities in communities dominated by the non-native alga. © 2011.;2012;2023-07-04 07:37:12;2024-04-10 14:19:49;;38-44;;;413;;J.

In Chesapeake Bay, the exotic macroalga Gracilaria vermiculophylla (Rhodophyta) has flourished and dispersed widely, yet the consequences for native species diversity and abundance are not well known. We experimentally examined the capacity of the structurally complex G. vermiculophylla to provide nursery habitat for the blue crab Callinectes sapidus in Chesapeake Bay, where native eelgrass nursery habitat has dwindled. We also examined ontogenetic shifts in survival across alternative nursery habitats. In field surveys, juvenile density was similar in macroalgae and eelgrass, but lower in unvegetated mud habitat. In field experiments, juvenile survival was positively related to crab size in mud but negatively in eelgrass, confirming the paradigm of a predationinduced ontogenetic shift from seagrass to unvegetated habitat. In contrast, irrespective of crab size, survival was higher in macroalgae than in either native habitat. Thus, exotic habitat-forming macroalgae can compensate for severe declines in seagrass nurseries, and facilitate the emergence of a novel ecosystem. © Inter-Research 2012.;2012;2023-07-04 07:37:16;2024-04-10 14:02:56;;137-146;;;467;;Mar.

The benthic assemblages colonized by C. racemosa were compared with non invaded assemblages at multiple spatial scales. In addition, a manipulative experiment has been conducted over a one-year period in order to compare the structure of native assemblages invaded by the alga with others where the alga has been manually removed and others that were not invaded. Results of both studies showed that Mediterranean soft-bottom assemblages invaded by C. racemosa differed from non invaded ones in terms of species composition, abundance and patterns of spatial variability. Moreover, in areas cleaned out from the alga, the benthic assemblages begin to recover their structure and after one year they get more similar to the assemblages observed in non invaded areas. The present paper, taking into account different aspects of C. racemosa invasion in Mediterranean soft bottoms, highlighted that the observed increase in alpha diversity did not correspond to an increase in the overall diversity of the studied system. Infact, the loss of beta diversity in invaded sites, together with the spread of species typical of vegetated habitats, may contribute to a homogenization of the Mediterranean coastal system. Furthermore, a possible role of ecosystem engineer for C. racemosa can be hypothesized. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.;2011;2023-07-04 07:37:17;2024-04-11 07:31:02;;2677-2690;;12;13;;Biol.

Along the Peruvian coast, beds of the mytilid Perumytilus purpuratus provide structurally complex habitats that harbour many organisms. We predict that in the nutrient-rich system of Central Peru, the modification of structural complexity would have stronger effects on the Perumytilus community than nutrient addition. We experimentally examined the effects of nutrient addition on the Perumytilus-dominated assemblage and we evaluated the potential effect of varying shell size on the Perumytilus-dominated assemblage. Nutrient addition to the mussel bed with slow-release fertilizers caused no changes in the total macro- and microalgal biomass and did not affect abundances or composition of the assemblage. To explore the effect of structural complexity on the Perumytilus assemblage, we manipulated mussel size with experimental bags containing small and large individuals. Predators, grazers and mobile organisms were more abundant among smaller mussels, with smaller gap volume, whereas the barnacle Jehlius cirratus was more abundant on larger mussels. In conclusion, point-source nutrient addition to the mussel bed did not enhance primary production. However, the modification of structural characteristics related to mussel size induced changes in the faunal assemblage. Thus, it seems that in this nutrient-rich system, nutrient enhancement would not significantly affect Perumytilus and its assemblage, whereas structural habitat seems to play an important role in shaping this community. © 2010 Springer-Verlag and AWI.;2011;2023-07-04 07:37:20;2024-04-11 08:23:20;;187-196;;2;65;;Helgol.

Comparisons of congeneric foundation species have mostly been limited to comparisons of native and invasive species, with less attention paid to multiple native species. Surfgrasses (Phyllospadix spp.) are ubiquitous foundation species on the coast of Oregon, USA, protecting resident invertebrates from waves and providing them with access to sandy substrate in an otherwise rocky habitat. Two native surfgrass species, P. scouleri and P. serru la - tus, have superficially similar morphological characteristics and co-occur within the same rocky intertidal zones. We investigated whether these native congeneric species function similarly as foundation species by comparing the 2 species' morphology, sediment accretion and associated resident macro - invertebrates at 3 capes that vary in oceanographic conditions. The results show that although the macroinvertebrate abundance was the same between surfgrass species, macroinvertebrate species richness, composition and functional groups varied considerably, with more infauna and deposit feeders found within P. serru la tus. P. serrulatus also had fewer tillers and rhizomes, and lower biomass per given area, but greater sediment accretion than its congener P. scouleri. One notably strong result was the difference in macroinvertebrate abundance among capes, with Cape Perpetua having 2.5-3 times more animals per given area than Capes Foulweather or Blanco. Overall, we conclude that although the 2 co-occurring surfgrass congeners provided functionally different habitat for resident macro - invertebrates, regional oceanographic processes (i.e. upwelling and productivity) may be more influential in determining the overall abundance and productivity of these diverse animal communities. © 2011 Inter-Research.;2011;2023-07-04 07:37:21;2024-04-11 07:39:38;;53-63;;;433;;Mar.

In this study we examined the species composition and density of macro-epiphytes and mobile fauna on the canopy-forming macroalga F. vesiculosus inhabiting different regimes of wave exposure in the North and Baltic Seas. The North and Baltic Seas had distinct epiphyte and mobile faunal communities. Wave exposure and segments of host fronds significantly contributed to the variability in species composition and dominance structure of epiphytes on F. vesiculosus in the North Sea and Baltic Sea. The study indicated that there is no clear spatial scale where environmental variables best predicted epiphytic and mobile faunal communities, and the formation of epiphytic and faunal communities is an interplay of factors operating through micro- to regional scales. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.;2011;2023-07-04 07:37:22;2024-04-11 08:06:00;;87-95;;SUPPL. 1;32;;Mar.

Although positive correlations between the diversities of habitat and associated animals are often observed, the underlying mechanisms are only now starting to emerge, and none have been tested specifically in the marine environment. Scleractinian corals constitute the primary habitat-forming organisms on coral reefs and, as such, play an important role in structuring associated reef fish communities. Using the same field experimental design in two geographic localities differing in regional fish species composition, we tested the effects of coral species richness and composition on the diversity, abundance, and structure of the local fish community. Richness of coral species overall had a positive effect on fish species richness but had no effect on total fish abundance or evenness. At both localities, certain individual coral species supported similar levels of fish diversity and abundance as the high coral richness treatments, suggesting that particular coral species are disproportionately important in promoting high local fish diversity. Furthermore, in both localities, different microhabitats (coral species) supported very different fish communities, indicating that most reef fish species distinguish habitat at the level of coral species. Fish communities colonizing treatments of higher coral species richness represented a combination of those inhabiting the constituent coral species. These findings suggest that mechanisms underlying habitat-animal interaction in the terrestrial environment also apply to marine systems and highlight the importance of coral diversity to local fish diversity. The loss of particular key coral species is likely to have a disproportionate impact on the biodiversity of associated fish communities. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.;2011;2023-07-04 07:37:22;2024-04-11 07:44:34;;2285-2298;;12;92;;Ecology;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Biodiversity; Habitat loss; Animals; Coral reefs; biodiversity; coexistence; species richness; habitat loss; climate change; abundance; fish; community structure; reef fish; colonization; Climate change; Reef fish; coral reefs; species diversity; coral reef; Australia; microhabitat; resources; Coral Reefs; Queensland; Scleractinia; Species richness; Great Barrier Reef; Anthozoa; marine environment; Kimbe Bay; resource availability; Resources; Fishes; animal; article; Coral Sea; species evenness; Pacific Ocean; Animalia; Papua New Guinea; fieldwork; Diversity patterns; Great Barrier Reef Australia; Habitat-animal interactions; Kimbe Bay northern Papua New Guinea; West New Britain; PATTERNS; DIVERSITY; DEGRADATION; CLIMATE; ABUNDANCE; SPECIALIZATION; FUTURE; PLANT-SPECIES RICHNESS; DEPENDENCE; diversity patterns; habitat-animal interactions; northern Papua New Guinea; WOODY PLANT; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While positive species interactions (i.e., facilitation) have historically been underemphasized in ecological research, they are increasingly recognized as playing important roles in the evolution and maintenance of biodiversity. Dominant habitat-forming species (foundation species) buffer environmental conditions and can therefore facilitate myriad associated species. Theory predicts that facilitation will be the dominant community-structuring force under harsh environmental conditions, where organisms depend on shelter for survival and predation is diminished. Wind-swept, arid Patagonian rocky shores are one of the most desiccating intertidal rocky shores ever studied, providing an opportunity to test this theory and elucidate the context-dependency of facilitation. Methodology/Principal Findings: Surveys across 2100 km of southern Argentinean coastline and experimental manipulations both supported theoretical predictions, with 43 out of 46 species in the animal assemblage obligated to living within the matrices of mussels for protection from potentially lethal desiccation stress and predators having no detectable impact on diversity. Conclusions/Significance: These results provide the first experimental support of long-standing theoretical predictions and reveal that in extreme climates, maintenance of whole-community diversity can be maintained by positive interactions that ameliorate physical stress. These findings have important conservation implications and emphasize that preserving foundation species should be a priority in remediating the biodiversity consequences of global climate change. © 2011 Silliman et al.;2011;2023-07-04 07:37:22;2024-07-31 13:26:40;;;;10;6;;PLoS ONE;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Animals; Bivalvia; Water Movements; biodiversity; Predatory Behavior; predation; Argentina; sediment; climate change; physiology; community structure; bivalve; climate; biota; physical stress; desiccation; physiological stress; Desiccation; water flow; Climate; animal; Biota; nonhuman; controlled study; environmental protection; species habitat; article; sea water; Seawater; Stress, Physiological; Geologic Sediments; geographic distribution; global climate; Animalia; Data Collection; information processing; geographical variation (species); DIVERSITY; DISTURBANCE; HABITAT; NEW-ZEALAND; POSITIVE INTERACTIONS; PREDATION; PRODUCTIVITY; NETWORKS; SPECIES INTERACTIONS; SALT MARSHES; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The magnitude of this influence often depends on the habitat complexity introduced by the engineers. It is commonly accepted that an increase in habitat complexity will result in an increase in diversity and/or abundance in the associated fauna. The rocky salt marshes along the coast of Patagonia are dominated by cordgrasses, mussels, and barnacles forming a mosaic of engineered habitats with different complexity. This system allows us to address the following questions: how different is a macroinvertebrate assemblage when dominated by different ecosystem engineers? And, is there a positive relationship between increasing habitat complexity and the species richness, diversity and total density of the assemblages? To address these questions, we compared the three ecological scenarios with decreasing habitat complexity: cordgrass-mussel, mussel, and barnacle-engineered habitats. We found a total of 22 taxa mostly crustaceans and polychaetes common to all scenarios. The three engineered habitats showed different macroinvertebrate assemblages, mainly due to differences in individual abundances of some taxa. The cryptogenic amphipod Orchestia gammarella was found strictly associated with the cordgrass-mussel habitat. Species richness and diversity were positively related with habitat complexity while total density showed the opposite trend. Our study suggests that species vary their relative distribution and abundances in response to different habitat complexity. Nevertheless, the direction (i. e., neutral, positive or negative) and intensity of the community's response seem to depend on the physiological requirements of the different species and their efficiency to readjust their local spatial distribution in the short term. © 2010 Springer-Verlag and AWI.;2011;2023-07-04 07:37:25;2024-07-31 13:05:50;;467-477;;4;65;;Helgol.

It is unclear, however, how different habitat types compare. Using large-scale field surveys, we compared the canopy and community structure between eelgrass and rockweed beds in Atlantic Canada and assessed their nitrogen retention, carbon storage, and habitat services. We then used binary network models of predator-prey interactions to determine food-web structure and its robustness to species loss. Despite disparate 3-dimensional canopy structure, both habitats significantly enhanced overall abundance and diversity of associated flora and fauna, including several commercially important species. Significant differences occurred in the species assemblages within and between habitats and were attributed to different settlement opportunities, food availability, predation risk, and maneuverability. While eelgrass plants had higher nitrogen content, rockweed canopies maintained 8-fold greater biomass and, thus, 14-fold greater nitrogen and 8-fold greater carbon retention per unit area. Both rockweed and eelgrass food webs showed similarities to other temperate and tropical seagrass webs, yet their robustness to the loss of most connected species including primary producers was among the lowest; underscoring their vulnerability to disturbances affecting the functionally dominant primary producers. The present study demonstrates that marine vegetation provides important habitat, nitrogen, and carbon storage services, yet the extent of these services depends on the foundation species and its architecture. Changes in canopy structure will therefore have profound effects on associated food webs and ecosystem services. Thus, as increasing human pressures on coastal ecosystems threaten the continued supply of essential functions and services, the protection of marine vegetated habitats should be a management priority. © Inter-Research 2011.";2011;2023-07-04 07:37:26;2024-07-31 14:16:53;;51-68;;;437;;Mar.

These structures can provide predation refuges and increase larval settlement and thereby increase the richness and abundance of fauna. We collected invertebrate samples from an intertidal flat with low onuphid tube density (2.7 m -2) in Mozambique and document that more organisms (70 times higher mollusc abundances) and more species (15 times more mollusc species) were found associated with solitary tubes of an onuphid polychaete compared with surrounding sand habitats. These results are in agreement with tube versus sand comparisons from soft-bottom systems in the North Atlantic where polychaete tube densities are often much higher. © NISC (Pty) Ltd.;2011;2023-07-04 07:37:27;2024-04-11 07:19:10;;327-332;;2;33;;Afr.

This study investigates the effect of Undaria pinnatifida on the abundance and diversity of benthic macrofauna in Golfo Nuevo, northern Patagonia, using a manipulative experiment involving the systematic removal of Undaria microthalli from strips of hard bottom during its eighth-month growing period. Species richness and diversity were higher in plots covered by Undaria than when Undaria was removed. Also, the abundance of two species of crustaceans, one species of sea urchin, one species of nemertina and several species of polychaetes was higher. We attribute these effects to the provision of new habitat structure by Undaria, a larger and structurally more complex species than the local native seaweeds. These results support the hypothesis that complex habitats enhance abundance and species richness, by offering different shelter and foraging opportunities compared to morphologically simpler habitats. Based on a review of diet studies in the region, we speculate that Undaria could potentially produce a bottom-up effect on local food chains by increasing abundance of prey for a wide variety of predators, from invertebrates to marine mammals. While our study has a narrow temporal and spatial scale, we expect similar effects of Undaria on the macrofauna in other sites of the Argentine coast, especially those dominated by small native macroalgae. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.;2011;2023-07-04 07:37:27;2024-04-11 08:19:09;;1521-1532;;7;13;;Biol.

The status of northern abalone and the characteristics of the habitats they associate with were determined showing that northern abalone have declined dramatically in Washington State with present day abundances <10% of those found in 1979. Northern abalone inhabited kelp beds (Nereocystis luetkeana), more than red sea urchin beds (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) (X 2=16, d.f. = 1, P<0.01) or habitats with both kelp and sea urchins (X 2=13.2, d.f. = 1, P<0.01). Sites with Nereocystis kelp canopy had twice the percentage cover of encrusting coralline algae compared with sea urchin sites. No juvenile abalone (<75mm) were found in any of the habitat types raising concerns about recruitment failure. Abalone co-occurred with other molluscs including limpets and scallops. Kelp holdfast microhabitats had significantly higher species richness (t=2.2, d.f. = 6, P<0.05), twice the effective number of species and 5x more individuals than sea urchin spine microhabitats. In laboratory choice experiments, juvenile abalone (20mm) preferred coralline rocks to kelp holdfasts or sea urchin spine canopy. The small snail, Amphissa spp. (5-15mm) was more abundant inside kelp holdfasts than under sea urchins or in rock cobble, suggesting this may be an important microhabitat. It is recommended that kelp beds with abundant coralline substrate be used for restoration including stocking juveniles and adult aggregations as this biogenic habitat may enhance northern abalone restoration actions. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.;2011;2023-07-04 07:37:28;2024-04-11 07:29:51;;573-581;;6;21;;Aquatic Conserv.

Individual- and population-level traits of engineering species are likely to determine their ability to modify the environment. Blue mussels function as important ecosystem engineer species in the Baltic Sea where they facilitate the existence of distinct associated communities. The population structure of these blue mussel beds fluctuates widely, but ecosystem effects of these fluctuations are poorly known. In this study, we experimentally and descriptively measured the effect of mussel succession stage with differing biomass, density and size structure on macrofaunal diversity and body size at 5 m depth. We found that mussel succession stage is an important determinant of faunal abundance, species richness and species assemblage. Our results demonstrate that mussel succession stage (size structure, density and biomass) highly affect the associated macrofaunal communities and the strength of facilitation in these systems. We also found that the body size of crustaceans and clams was positively correlated with mussel body size, increasing with a growing mussel body size. We suggest that it is of high importance to consider individual traits of ecosystem engineers and the types of environments in which they play critical roles in order to increase the value of the ecosystem engineering concept in ecology and conservation biology. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.;2011;2023-07-04 07:37:30;2024-04-11 07:53:26;;945-954;;5;158;;Mar.

In a field experiment, biogenic habitat complexity was manipulated (presence or absence of foliose macroalgae) at two depths (2-3 m and 5-6 m) and the habitat-dependent effects on recruitment of the black foot abalone (Haliotis iris) were examined at three field sites along the south coast of Wellington, New Zealand (41°20′S, 174°47′E), between July and November 2005. Recruit density (<5 weeks post-settlement) was measured on cobbles covered with crustose coralline algae. Habitats of low complexity (barrens treatments) had consistently greater densities of recruits than habitats of high complexity (algae treatments). However, recruits in algae habitats were larger, and for deep habitats, there was greater survival in algae habitats compared with barrens habitats. While depth had no significant effect on early recruit (<2 weeks post-settlement) density, late recruit (<5 weeks post-settlement) density was greater in shallow habitats, and so it seems recruit survival was greater in shallow habitats. In this experiment, algal habitat complexity had strong effects on early recruit abundance, but habitat-dependent variations in recruit growth and survival may modify initial patterns of abundance and determine recruitment to adult abalone populations. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.;2011;2023-07-04 07:37:31;2024-04-11 08:59:24;;505-513;;3;158;;Mar.

An investigation to quantify the biodiversity of two L. hians beds was carried out during the winter and summer seasons at two sites on the west coast of Scotland. Cores were taken semi-randomly through 100% L. hians nest material, organisms removed, identified and enumerated. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the data were used to establish temporal and locational differences. A total of 7275 individuals were found representing 282 species from 16 phyla. Univariate analysis revealed significant differences between the species richness of the two populations, whilst multivariate analysis illustrated differences in the assemblage compositions between sites and times.

According to landscape ecology, the configuration (distance apart and spatial arrangement) of patches of engineered habitat within landscapes can also influence the physical environment and biodiversity. To examine the influence of a model engineer, the marine intertidal mussel Trichomya hirsuta, abiotic variables (sand deposition, temperature, and humidity) and biotic variables (species richness, numbers of unique species, densities of generalist species and entire assemblages) were compared between engineered and unmodified habitat and between different configurations of engineered patches. By keeping the number of habitat patches (i.e. mussels) constant, the effect of patch configuration (in terms of degree of patch aggregation) on the same abiotic and biotic variables was investigated. Mussels were found to trap large amounts of sand and engineer intertidal habitat that was cooler and, to a lesser extent, more humid during low tides. Mussels also had more species, more unique species and different assemblages compared to habitat without mussels. Different configurations of mussels had similar effects on the physical environment and had similar assemblages as a whole. Most importantly, regularly spaced solitary mussels had more edge and consequently more species, unique species and densities of generalists. These key findings suggest that the configuration of patches of habitat is a crucial factor affecting mussel bed biodiversity, and fragmentation of habitat into regularly spaced patches may have a positive influence on biodiversity due to the positive response of other species to habitat edges. © Inter-Research 2010.;2010;2023-07-04 07:37:33;2024-04-11 12:34:47;;127-136;;;416;;Mar.

Many studies have described variable effects of foundation species on community diversity at small scales, but net positive effects over large scales. Egregia menziesii (Turner) J.E. Areschoug is a large and robust perennial kelp that creates a structurally complex habitat on rocky shores of the Northeast Pacific. This study investigated the effects of Egregia sporophytes on benthic assemblages of the rocky intertidal along the central California coast. Egregia sporophytes strongly impacted the structure of associated communities, due to wave-driven whiplash of fronds, shading, or habitat provision. A survey of Egregia populations at 10 stations along 200. km of the central California coast found effects of Egregia density on the intertidal to be consistent among sites. Increased Egregia sporophyte density negatively affected algal species richness, total algal cover, and cover of the most conspicuous species of algae. However, there was a positive relationship with algal crusts, geniculate coralline algae, and sessile invertebrates. Egregia removal experiments at two sites within the study area experimentally tested for the effects of Egregia on intertidal communities. Results from Soberanes Pt. were consistent with survey results because of the negative effect of Egregia on algal species diversity, subcanopy layering, and cover of abundant algal species. However, removal experiments at Pigeon Pt. resulted in a positive Egregia effect on algal diversity and cover of abundant algal species possibly due to lower Egregia densities, lower wave exposure than Soberanes Pt., and stress amelioration. In the lower energy environment, Egregia acted as a sand trap, yet sand accumulation did not negatively impact algal diversity. Negative effects of large brown algae on benthic assemblages have been observed in temperate waters around the world for certain intertidal or subtidal kelp in wave-swept environments allowing for scouring and substrate shading. This study shows that Egregia and morphologically similar brown algal species can have both negative and positive effects on community diversity depending on variation in density and local environmental conditions. Egregia has the opposite effect on community diversity than what has been previously reported for foundation species because it negatively affects biodiversity in stressful environments, but has a positive effect in less stressful environments. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.;2010;2023-07-04 07:37:33;2024-04-11 12:20:21;;90-99;;1-2;393;;J.

The biotic structuring factor has never before been investigated from a very small scale-perspective. The latter is the subject of the present study. In an in situ experimental sampling design, the structuring effect of biogenic reefs on the distribution of Pleuronectes platessa (Plaice) in an intertidal nursery area is investigated. The density distribution of this flatfish species is significantly (p < 0.0001) explained by the presence of reefs built up by the polychaete Lanice conchilega. The importance of this reef builder has been highlighted before in other studies but present study demonstrates that not only the benthic biodiversity is affected by L. conchilega reefs, but that the distribution pattern of P. platessa is structured by them as well. This structuring impact of small-scale benthic reefs creating a patchy environment in nursery areas potentially plays an important role in other marine environments and indicates the need for further research on the ecological function of benthic reef environments for several flatfish species. Further modification of these biogenic habitats may lead to a loss of one or more ecosystem functions which flatfish species depend on. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In February 2010, a large, surviving population of A. cervicornis was surveyed at Cabezos del Cayo, Punta Rusia, Dominican Republic to document its present condition and potential threats to its persistence. The A. cervicornis surveyed at Cabezos del Cayo provides a rare glimpse of the habitat structure that these keystone components of coral reefs once provided. The staghorn population covers an area of 2 ha and is formed by interlocking skeletons of unusually large and thick A. cervicornis colonies. The large size of its colonies (maximum branch length 250 cm; average linear length of live tissue 471 cm; maximum number of branch tips 141 per colony; maximum branch diameter 5 cm) and the complex open canopy of these colonies, have not been described, to our knowledge, in the recent literature. The site is within Montecristi National Park but there is no active protection in this area and signs of overfishing are evident based on low fish abundance and complete lack of fish >20 cm in length. The stressors associated with this population include significant predation by gastropods and fireworms, overgrowth by macroalgae, damselfish 'gardening' activities, and white band disease. The management priority for the staghorn population at Cabezos del Cayo, Dominican Republic, should be to enforce the legal framework that is already in place for the protection of Montecristi National Park, limiting unsustainable and damaging fishing practices, and limiting land-based sources of pollution associated with increasing population numbers and future coastal development.

The alga Caulerpa taxifolia is one of the most successful invasive species of shallow-water marine systems globally, often provisioning habitat in areas previously lacking in vegetated structure. We experimentally evaluated the direct effect of Caulerpa to provide refuge for the native clam Anadara trapezia and how this balances with its influence on two trait-mediated indirect interactions that may increase Anadara's susceptibility to predators. Specifically, Caulerpa's alteration of physical and chemical properties of the surrounding water and sediment deteriorate Anadara's condition and predator resistance properties and also cause Anadara, though normally buried, to project from beneath the sediment, exposing it to predators. Our results show that Anadara are somewhat (but not consistently) protected from predators by living among Caulerpa. Shallow burial depth did not counteract this protective effect. However at times of year when predator activity diminishes and conducive environmental conditions develop, negative effects of Caulerpa habitat such as hypoxia and lowered flow may dominate. Under such situations, poor clam condition accentuates Anadara's susceptibility to mortality. Ultimately, a slight and inconsistent positive effect of Caulerpa to protect Anadara from predators is exceeded by the strong negative effect of Caulerpa on clam mortality, which is heightened by clams' weakened condition produced by chronic exposure to Caulerpa. Our results show that invasive habitat-modifying species can affect mortality of native species not simply through obvious positive direct effects of their protective structure, but indirectly through contrasting negative modification of the traits of prey species responding to the habitat. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.;2010;2023-07-04 07:37:40;2024-04-11 12:53:05;;1787-1798;;6;91;;Ecology;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Animals; Ecosystem; ecosystem engineering; foundation species; Bivalvia; Foundation species; predation; ecosystem; Ecosystem engineering; physiology; algae; Anadara trapezia; mortality; bivalve; nonnative species; invasive species; predator-prey interaction; Australia; Caulerpa taxifolia; benthic infauna; refuge; marine ecosystem; Trait-mediated indirect interactions; Caulerpa; shallow water; Nonnative species; longevity; animal; environmental protection; article; Conservation of Natural Resources; sublethal effect; native species; behavioral response; New South Wales; habitat creation; physicochemical property; green alga; Longevity; soft-bottom environment; Anadara; Arcidae; Behavioral modification; Benthic infauna; Caulerpa taxifoha; New south wales; Prey refuges; Soft sediment communities; Sublethal effects; RECRUITMENT; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; MECHANISMS; PREDATION; COMPLEXITY; BIVALVE; PREY; ALGA CAULERPA-TAXIFOLIA; REFUGE; behavioral modification; New South Wales, Australia; prey refuges; soft sediment communities; sublethal effects; trait-mediated indirect interactions; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Still, much uncertainty exists about how individual and population-level traits of these species contribute to ecosystem processes and how engineering species jointly affect biodiversity. In this manipulative field experiment, we examined how biodiversity in marginal blue mussel beds is affected by blue mussel (1) body size, density and patch context and (2) presence of fucoid and algal structures. In the study area, bladder-wrack (Fucusvesiculosus), filamentous algae and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) coexist at shallow depths in a variety of patch configurations and offer complex habitats with a high variability of resources. We hypothesized that complexity in terms of mussel bed structure and algal presence determines species composition and abundance. Results from the experiment were compared with macrofaunal communities found in natural populations of both engineering species. Results show that the physical structure and blue mussel patch context are important determinants for species composition and abundance. Results further show that the presence of algal structures positively affects diversity in blue mussel habitats due to increased surface availability and complexity that these algae offer. This study shows that blue mussel beds at the very margin of their distribution have an indisputable function for promoting and maintaining biodiversity and suggest that facilitative effects of habitat-modifying species are important on Baltic Sea rocky shores with fundamental importance to community structure. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.;2010;2023-07-04 07:37:40;2024-04-11 12:14:31;;1463-1474;;7;157;;Mar.

C. gigas settles predominantly on intertidal Mytilus-beds (M. edulis L.) and subsequently create rigid reef-like structures. Both bivalve species are ecosystem engineers in sedimentary tidal flats. They provide hard substrate for sessile species, mobile organisms find refuge within the habitat matrix of dense suspension feeders, and biodeposits enrich the sediments with organic matter. The transformation of Mytilus-beds into Crassostrea-reefs gives rise to the question whether the invader may affect the native community. We investigated two parts of a changing bivalve bed in the backbarrier area of the island of Juist in March 2005. One part was still dominated by M. edulis whereas the other part was already densely colonized by C. gigas. Crassostrea-reefs compensate for the conceivable loss of Mytilus-beds in the intertidal of the Wadden Sea by replacing the ecological function of M. edulis. There was no indication of a suppression of indigenous species. This even applied to M. edulis, which persisted at the site invaded by C. gigas. The associated macrofaunal community showed increased species richness, abundance, biomass, and diversity in the Crassostrea-reef. The latter particularly favored sessile species like anthozoans, hydrozoans, and barnacles. Higher abundance and biomass for vagile epizoic species like the shore crab Carcinus maenas and the periwinkle Littorina littorea also occurred among oysters. Abundance of deposit feeding oligochaetes was enhanced by oysters as well. More opportunistic, facultative filter-feeding polychaetes occurred in the Crassostrea-reef. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.;2010;2023-07-04 07:37:42;2024-04-11 11:45:45;;15-32;;1;12;;Biol.

Five treatments were established, including artificial shade cover, root simulated structure, mix (shade and structure) and control of the canopy gap (which had no mangrove vegetation), in addition to forest control under the mangrove canopy. Following 18 months of observation, species' richness and abundance of epifauna were found to have increased in shaded treatments, which had low temperature and high moisture substrate. Food resource conditions had also altered from abundant microphytobenthos (relatively high nutritional values) to enriched mangrove detritus due to shading. These results indicated that the physical structure of mangrove vegetation facilitates the habitation of intertidal epifauna, canopy shade having an important function in providing cooler wetter surface substrate, despite also inducing a reduction of favorable food resources (i.e. microphytobenthos). © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Through factorial manipulation of clam (0, 62.5, 125 clams m-2) and eelgrass density (present, removed by hand, harrowed), we examined intra- and inter-specific effects on performance, as well as modification of the physical environment. The presence of eelgrass reduced water flow by up to 40% and was also observed to retain water at low tide, which may ameliorate desiccation and explain why eelgrass grew faster in the presence of conspecifics (positive feedback). Although shell growth of small (20-50 mm) clams was not consistently affected by either treatment in this 2-month experiment, clam condition improved when eelgrass was removed. Reciprocally, clams at aquaculture densities had no effect on eelgrass growth, clam growth and condition, or porewater nutrients. Overall, only Z. japonica demonstrated strong population-level interactions. Interspecific results support an emerging paradigm that invasive marine ecosystem engineers often negatively affect infauna.

Current and predicted human-induced changes to ecosystems require a mechanistic understanding of how foundation species enable the persistence of diverse, functioning ecological communities. By manipulating the abundance of a putative foundation species of rocky intertidal tidepool communities, the seagrass Phyllospadix spp. (surfgrass), this study assesses how surfgrass affects the thermal environment and structure of tidepool communities over a period of two years. Surfgrass removal pools experienced temperatures up to 10°C higher than control pools during low tide. Changes in community composition of sessile organism accompanied this change in thermal regime. Over two years, removal pools saw a significant decline in the abundance of coralline crusts and bare space and an increase in the abundance of foliose red algae while control pool communities remained stable. At the level of functional groups, community similarity metrics showed pool communities became more variable in space in response to surfgrass removal, demonstrating that pool communities diverge dramatically in the absence of surfgrass. In removal pools, recovery of surfgrass was limited with less than 25% of pre-removal abundance after two years. However, removal pool communities shifted toward species compositions that favor surfgrass recruitment and suggest a mechanism by which surfgrass recovery may be enhanced over the long-term. Surfgrass clearly play a foundational role in tidepools by reducing pool temperatures and act to stabilize tidepool communities. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.;2010;2023-07-04 07:37:44;2024-04-11 09:16:50;;35-42;;1-2;391;;J.

This research has shown that shells of O. edulis do show higher species diversity than non-living hard substrata and as oysters grow larger epibiotic diversity will increase. This investigation has revealed that O. edulis possesses biogenic engineering qualities and the value of O. edulis as a vehicle for increasing biodiversity should not be underestimated. Relatively few studies have examined the shell surfaces of Ostrea edulis, which, together with their associated epifauna provide a large portion of the natural hard substrata for sessile filter-feeding organisms, including oysters, in coastal and estuarine ecosystems.

Additionally, a mosaic environment of engineered and non-engineered habitats has been shown to increase biodiversity. Non-native ecosystem engineers can be introduced into environments that do not contain or have lost species that form biogenic habitat, resulting in dramatic impacts upon native communities. Yet, little is known about how non-native ecosystem engineers interact with natives and other non-natives already present in the environment, specifically whether non-native ecosystem engineers facilitate other non-natives, and whether they increase habitat heterogeneity and alter the diversity, abundance, and distribution of benthic species. Through sampling and experimental removal of reefs, we examine the effects of a non-native reef-building tubeworm, Ficopomatus enigmaticus, on community composition in the central Californian estuary, Elkhorn Slough. Tubeworm reefs host significantly greater abundances of many non-native polychaetes and amphipods, particularly the amphipods Monocorophium insidiosum and Melita nitida, compared to nearby mudflats. Infaunal assemblages under F. enigmaticus reefs and around reef's edges show very low abundance and taxonomic diversity. Once reefs are removed, the newly exposed mudflat is colonized by opportunistic non-native species, such as M. insidiosum and the polychaete Streblospio benedicti, making removal of reefs a questionable strategy for control. These results show that provision of habitat by a non-native ecosystem engineer may be a mechanism for invasional meltdown in Elkhorn Slough, and that reefs increase spatial heterogeneity in the abundance and composition of benthic communities. © The Author 2010.

In coastal areas, investigations and manipulative experiments on benthic biodiversity and ecosystem functioning at depths up to >50 m have been recently made possible by the progress of SCUBA techniques. In this study, we tested the effects of the presence of a gorgonian forest characterised by a large and dense population of the gold coral Savalia savaglia (Bertoloni 1819) on the benthic biodiversity (nematode species richness, and meiofauna community structure and richness of taxa), trophic guilds state (molluscs) and ecosystem functioning in the surrounding sediments. The S. savaglia colonies create elevated and complex tertiary structures. Our results indicate that the presence of these colonies was associated with a significantly increased deposition of bioavailable substrates and enhanced biodiversity, when compared with soft bottoms at the same depth but without gold corals. The higher biodiversity and altered trophic conditions resulted in higher rates of ecosystem functioning (e.g., higher benthic biomasses). These results suggest that S. savaglia should be particularly protected not only for its specific rarity, endemism and vulnerability but also because it has a prominent role in sustaining high levels of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the surrounding benthos of the twilight zone. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.;2010;2023-07-04 07:37:46;2024-04-11 12:36:09;;153-167;;1;19;;Biodiversity Conserv.;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Ecosystem engineers; biodiversity; species richness; benthos; Mollusca; coral; Mediterranean Sea; meiofauna; vulnerability; coastal zone; marine ecosystem; population density; Anthozoa; restoration ecology; Gorgonia; twilight; endemism; DIVERSITY; ECOLOGY; GROWTH; SEA; ORGANIC-MATTER; BIOCHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; FLOW; DEEP; SEDIMENTS; Benthic biodiversity; BIOGEOCHEMISTRY; Deep corals; Savalia savaglia; ⭐; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A large number of experimental and theoretical studies have focused on the effects of changes in species richness and identity, while the role of variation in species abundance has received less attention in biodiversity experiments. By using an experimental design that effectively separates the effects of species richness and identity, while controlling for variation in species abundance, we examined the consequences of loss of 2 habitat-forming species (the canopy alga Cystoseira compressa and the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis) in Mediterranean low-shore assemblages of algae and invertebrates. Results revealed significant effects associated with changes in number and identity of habitatforming species on other organisms. The magnitude and direction of these effects, however, changed as a function of the abundance of manipulated species. Our findings indicate how changes in biodiversity of even 2 species can result in complex effects, stressing the importance of investigating nonrandom loss of habitat-forming species and the need to consider density-dependent effects in biodiversity experiments, particularly when experiments are undertaken in systems like rocky shores, where density-dependent effects are pervasive. © 2009 Inter-Research.;2009;2023-07-04 07:37:50;2024-07-31 14:37:02;;39-49;;;381;;Mar.

In soft-sediment estuaries, hard substrate is a limited resource, which can increase with the introduction of hard habitat-creating non-native species. Positive interactions between non-native, habitat-creating species and non-native species utilizing such habitats could be a mechanism for enhanced invasion success. Most previous studies on aquatic invasive habitat-creating species have demonstrated positive responses in associated communities, but few have directly addressed responses of other non-native species. We explored the association of native and non-native species with invasive habitat-creating species by comparing communities associated with non-native, reef-building tubeworms Ficopomatus enigmaticus and native oysters Ostrea conchaphila in Elkhorn Slough, a central California estuary. Non-native habitat supported greater densities of associated organisms-primarily highly abundant non-native amphipods (e.g. Monocorophium insidiosum, Melita nitida), tanaid (Sinelebus sp.), and tube-dwelling polychaetes (Polydora spp.). Detritivores were the most common trophic group, making up disproportionately more of the community associated with F. enigmaticus than was the case in the O. conchaphila community. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that native species' community structure varied significantly among sites, but not between biogenic habitats. In contrast, non-natives varied with biogenic habitat type, but not with site. Thus, reefs of the invasive tubeworm F. enigmaticus interact positively with other non-native species. © Inter-Research 2008.;2008;2023-07-04 07:37:51;2024-04-12 07:19:25;;47-56;;1;2;;Aqua.

Multivariate analyses revealed that the mudflat benthic assemblage and Zostera meadow assemblage showed highest similarities, whereas the Spartina marsh assemblage showed the highest dissimilarity with these two areas. Whereas the descriptive nature of our study limits interpretation of the data, some clear patterns were observed. For all vegetated areas, species diversity was lower compared to the unvegetated mudflat, and we observed a strong shift from endo-towards epibenthic species, suggesting that increased above-ground habitat complexity may be a main driving process in our system. As there were no clear patterns related to feeding types, food availability/productivity appeared to be of minor importance in structuring the benthic assemblages. Nevertheless, animals were in general smaller in vegetated areas. Patchiness had a distinct positive effect on biodiversity. © The Author(s) 2008.;2009;2023-07-04 07:37:52;2024-07-12 12:18:10;;3-18;;1;63;;Helgol. Mar.

Species composition, abundance, richness and diversity were estimated from monthly or bimonthly samples obtained by SCUBA diving. Multivariate (MDS) and SIMPER analyses were applied to analyse the structure of benthic communities. In the mats, a total of 57 species (invertebrates and chordates) belonging to 11 phyla were associated to P. socialis: crustaceans and molluscs were the most abundant species and crustaceans and polychaetes were the most diverse groups (14 and 11 species richness, respectively). The mean abundance ranged from 79.67±57.47 ind/250ml to 718.75 ind/250ml (mean±SD). The amphipod Monocorophium insidiosum, the gastropod Anachis isabellei and the tanaidacean Leptognathia sp. were the most representative species in the mats. Richness and diversity in P. socialis aggregates were higher than in surrounding sediments. Results show significant differences among months in composition, abundance and feeding guilds of the macrofauna associated with the mats. The assemblage of benthic macrofauna with permanent and temporary organisms in P. socialis aggregates suggests the existence of microhabitats in the mats that provide substrate, refuges for predation and availability of food increasing richness and diversity. These results allow considering P. socialis as an autogenic ecosystem engineer in the Mar del Plata harbour. © 2009 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.;2009;2023-07-04 07:37:53;2024-04-11 14:19:56;;1099-1108;;6;89;;J.

In this study, we attempt to characterize and explain infaunal and epifaunal abundance patterns across scales in a spatially complex, intertidal, soft-bottom habitat: beds of the semi-infaunal mussel, Mytilus edulis. We used univariate and multivariate analyses in a nested sampling design at three locations in eastern Maine to show the relationships between environmental and macrofaunal assemblage variables. The results support the hypotheses that: 1) environmental and macrofaunal assemblage variables vary widely across spatial scales and exhibit maximum variance at different spatial scales; 2) abundance and diversity patterns of macrofauna are linked to spatial variation in environmental variables in the form of biogenic structure (live mussels and mussel shell hash), terrestrially-derived gravel, and, to a lesser degree, the proportion of silt-clay in the sediment; and 3) epifauna are generally positively correlated with hard-substrate features such as live mussels and gravel, and negatively correlated with the silt-clay content of the sediment, although the latter relationships were not strong. On the other hand, the results did not support the hypotheses that: 4) most infauna, specifically those with free-swimming larvae, are negatively correlated with live mussels and silt-clay proportion; instead, they were often positively correlated with live mussels and had weak, insignificant correlations with silt-clay; and 5) infauna without free-swimming larvae are positively correlated with live mussels and silt-clay proportion; instead, they showed some positive correlations with live mussels, but a mix of weak, insignificant correlations with silt-clay. Thus, mussel beds had a variety of scale-dependent relationships, both positive and negative, with each of the macrofaunal groups. The results show that biogenic structure in the form of live mussels and mussel shell hash is important in this system, as is terrestrial gravel, and that these variables are more important than silt-clay content for the macrofaunal assemblage. Mussel beds play an important role in regulating macrofaunal diversity in soft-bottom habitats, and their effects vary across spatial scales. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Although C. taxifolia covers large areas of soft-sediment habitat, little is known about its effects on soft-sediment invertebrate assemblages. We compared soft-sediment macroinvertebrate assemblages in 2 estuaries in southeastern Australia invaded by C. taxifolia to examine 2 main predictions: (1) areas covered with C. taxifolia will have different assemblages compared to unvegetated sediment because infauna are inhibited but epifauna are facilitated, and (2) areas with C. taxifolia will have different assemblages compared to those with native seagrasses (Halophila ovalis and Zostera capricorni) because infauna are inhibited but epifauna are not. Multidimensional scaling and ANOSIM showed differences in invertebrate assemblages between all habitats. In C. taxifolia, infauna were less abundant and epifauna were more abundant compared to unvegetated sediment. However, when compared to native seagrasses, epifauna in C. taxifolia were more abundant than in H. ovalis in one estuary but less abundant than in Z. capricorni in another estuary, while infauna in C. taxifolia were less abundant than in both seagrass species. The consistently low infaunal abundance in C. taxifolia, irrespective of infaunal feeding mode, suggests C. taxifolia impacts infauna generally. Examination of environmental factors potentially responsible for the low abundance of infauna indicated that differences in redox potential (and associated chemical changes) may explain patterns in abundance of infauna among habitats. Our findings indicate that invasion by C. taxifolia causes important changes to soft-sediment macroinvertebrate assemblages and suggest that infauna may be particularly vulnerable to invasion because of changes to sediment chemistry. © Inter-Research 2009.;2009;2023-07-04 07:37:58;2024-04-11 13:07:13;;59-71;;;380;;Mar.

This ecosystem role depends largely on the morphological characteristics and structural complexity of seagrass beds, including their ecological importance for fish species. This study examined relationships between seagrass bed characteristics and associated fish communities in mixed seagrass beds. Correspondence analysis (CA) and canonical correlation analysis (CCoA) were performed to estimate relationships for individual seagrass bed characteristics. The CCoA results revealed that species richness and three-dimensional structure of seagrass had great effect on the biomass and richness of the associated fish community. The CA results revealed that the relative importance of seagrass bed characteristics differed among fish functional groups including fishes appearing on the surface of, inside, and on the bottom of seagrass beds. The fishes found on the surface of the beds preferred beds with low seagrass biomass and high three-dimensional structure, those inside the beds preferred beds with high seagrass biomass and high three-dimensional structure, and those on the bottom of the beds preferred locations with low seagrass biomass and low three-dimensional structure. The results of this study provide compelling evidence that seagrass beds with high species diversity and high three-dimensional structure, but intermediate biomass, may provide the great benefit to the associated fish community. Such niche complementarity among fishes may be a process facilitated by seagrass diversity for secondary production as an ecosystem functioning. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.;2009;2023-07-04 07:37:58;2024-04-11 13:13:13;;1447-1458;;7;156;;Mar.

To test the effects of these habitat-generating suspension feeders on associated macrozoobenthos, a field experiment was designed. Circular plots ('rings') were composed either of oysters, mussels, both together or none at all. These four treatments were arranged in June 2006 in 5 blocks along low tide line. Rings enclose 3 m2 of bare muddy sand surrounded by a 1-m-wide belt (10 m2) of the densely packed epibenthic suspension feeders. Sediment, infauna, mobile epifauna and settling sessile epifauna were sampled. Epibenthic suspension feeders caused an accumulation of fine particles and organic content in the sediment. This was particularly true for mixed treatments indicating interactive effects of both bivalves on sediment characteristics. Mussels caused finer sediment grain-size composition compared to bare sediment. This did not occur among oysters but both bivalves increased organic content. The presence of mussels and oysters increased the abundance of infaunal and epibenthic mobile species differently. The polychaete Lanice conchilega was more abundant on oyster rings and the oligochaete Tubificoides benedeni on mussel rings. Densities of juvenile shore crabs Carcinus maenas and young periwinkles Littorina littorea (< 10 mm shell height) were higher on mussel rings; while abundance of L. littorea ≥ 10 mm shell height was higher on oyster rings. Juveniles of the barnacle Elminius modestus and of mussels showed no preference while oyster spat preferentially settled on conspecifics. We conclude that a shift in dominance from mussels to oysters alters habitat structures which entail differential abundances of associated organisms. This exchange of suspension feeder species is not neutral to community structure because resident mussels and alien oysters function differently as ecosystem engineers. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We examined intertidal mussel beds at four distant locations around the globe with the same sampling method, to find out whether this ""hot spot"" designation holds universally. We studied species assemblages within the matrices of byssally interconnected mussels engineered by Mytilus edulis in the North Sea, by mixed Perumytilus purpuratus and Mytilus chilensis at the southern Chilean coast, by Musculista senhousia in the Yellow Sea and by Xenostrobus inconstans at the coast of southern Australia. In all cases, species assemblages inside mussel beds were significantly different from those outside with many species being restricted to one habitat type. However, species richness and diversity were not generally higher in mussel beds than in ambient sediments without mussels. In the North Sea (M. edulis) and at the Chilean coast (P. purpuratus, M. chilensis), mussel beds have markedly higher species numbers and diversities than surrounding sediments, but this was not the case for mussel beds in Australia (X. inconstans) and the Yellow Sea (M. senhousia) where numbers of associated species were only slightly higher and somewhat lower than in adjacent sediments, respectively. In conclusion, although soft bottom mytilid mussels generally enhance habitat heterogeneity and species diversity at the ecosystem level, mussel beds themselves are not universal centres of biodiversity, but the effects on associated species are site specific. © Springer-Verlag and AWI 2008.";2009;2023-07-04 07:37:59;2024-04-11 13:17:20;;47-58;;1;63;;Helgol.

The effects of L. conchilega on the surrounding benthic community have received little attention, especially in subtidal areas. Therefore, the presence of L. conchilega in different habitats in the North Sea and its effect on the abundance, species richness, diversity and community structure in these habitats are evaluated in the present paper, based on data from the ICES North Sea Benthos Survey of 2000. Lanice conchilega has a wide geographical distribution and a low habitat specialization, but optimally occurs in shallow fine sands. In the present study, the presence of L. conchilega resulted in a density increase and a significant (positive) correlation of the benthos density with the density of L. conchilega. Furthermore, the species richness (number of species) increased with increasing density of L. conchilega. This trend was, however, not consistent: the number of species reached more or less an asymptotic value or even decreased after reaching a critical density of L. conchilega (>500-1,000 ind/m2), as observed in shallow fine sands. The same overall pattern was detected concerning the expected number of species. The N 1-diversity index showed similar or slightly higher values in L. conchilega patches compared to patches without L. conchilega. From the results of the community analysis, it can be concluded that the species, which were responsible for the increase of the diversity, belonged to the overall species-pool of that habitat. The effects on density and diversity differed between the four discerned habitats (shallow muddy sand, shallow fine sand, shallow medium sand and deep fine sand), and were most pronounced in shallow fine sands. These patterns can be attributed to the habitat structuring capacity of L. conchilega. The mechanisms responsible for the increase of the habitat quality in patches of L. conchilega can be summarized as (1) changes in the hydrodynamics, (2) increases of the habitat stability and oxygen supply, and (3) a creation of habitat heterogeneity in a uniform environment. In this way, L. conchilega alters the habitat characteristics and affects other organisms, and can therefore even be considered as an ecosystem engineer. In other words, L. conchilega patches are responsible for an increased habitat quality in an otherwise uniform habitat, which results in a higher survival of the surrounding benthic species. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.;2008;2023-07-04 07:38:02;2024-04-12 06:27:03;;1009-1019;;6;154;;Mar.

Peracarida are common inhabitants of biological substrata, such as algae, sponges and ascidians and have been proven to be very sensitive to changes in environmental conditions. The aim of this study was to present and analyse, for the first time, the structure of the peracarid epifaunal assemblage inhabiting this Mediterranean endemic, edible and commercially exploited species. During sampling in the North Aegean Sea, 41 specimens were collected and examined for their peracarid epifauna. Overall, 38 peracarid species were identified, a high number in comparison to those recorded in the few other relevant studies on ascidian epifauna. The great majority of the species were amphipods. By contrast, in terms of abundance, tanaidaceans was the dominant taxon, with Leptochelia savigni being by far the most dominant species. Tube-dwelling suspension-feeders dominated the peracarid epifauna of this tunicate. The suspension feeding mode of epifaunal peracarids is possibly favoured by the high filtration rate of M. sabatieri which is large sized and has an extensive branchial surface. It is suggested that the tube-dwelling habit of tanaidaceans and some amphipods offering extra protection, may further explain their dominance as elements of the epifauna, in contrast to other inquiline peracarids which prefer to search for shelter inside the canals of sponges or, in a few cases inside the mantle cavity of ascidians. Differences in peracarid abundance among the ascidian specimens were attributed to the reproductive and dispersal habits of the former. Species richness, abundance and diversity of the motile peracarid epifauna was dependent on the biomass of the ascidian, but most strongly on the biomass of the sessile epibiontic organisms, such as algae and sponges which, in some cases, had a higher biomass than the ascidian itself. Thus, M. sabatieri with its wrinkled surface usually supporting a rich sessile epiflora and epifauna provides a favourable habitat for a quite homogenous peracarid assemblage. A thorough study of the entire community associated with M. sabatieri and its comparison with that in the surrounding environment could further elucidate the role of this organism in the enrichment of local biodiversity. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

From June 2003 to November 2004, we censused macrofauna and measured canopy cover within 4 × 10 m strips of alternating Canopy Intact (control) and Canopy Removed treatments in both a Codium- and a Laminaria-dominated habitat in the rocky subtidal zone of a semi-protected embayment on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. Macroalgal canopy cover fluctuated seasonally, peaking in September/October (69% cover in 2003; 55% cover in 2004) for Codium and in May 2004 (70% cover) for kelps, and with both canopy types reaching a winter minimum in January 2004 (22 and 28% cover, respectively). In both Codium and Laminaria habitats, significant effects of canopy removal on the overall macrofaunal assemblage were evident only during periods in which canopy cover in the Canopy Intact treatment was ≥ 50%. In the Codium habitat, 4 out of 11 characteristic taxa were more abundant in the Canopy Intact treatment, where taxonomic diversity also was higher. In contrast, 4 out of 11 characteristic taxa in the Laminaria habitat were more abundant in the Canopy Removed treatment and diversity was similar between treatments. Turf algae were sampled in November 2004 and, despite between-treatment differences in the light regime, there was no significant effect of canopy removal.

If spatial and/or temporal variations in the benthos are related to properties of the sediment, one can infer that sediments should vary and change at similar scales to the benthos. The mangrove forests of Sydney Harbour, Australia consist of distinct subhabitats (termed MH1-3, representing a change from open mudflat to canopied mangrove forest), which might affect benthos and, independently, properties of the sediment. This study tests the model that the benthos and sediment would respond to environmental differences between MH1-3 similarly in different locations and thus show consistent patterns of difference among habitats. Although general patterns of sediment properties and benthos were relatively similar, detailed patterns varied among locations. The relative importance of the different sedimentary properties varied in unpredictable ways among habitats in the different locations. Out of all the variables, only total carbohydrate was consistently important in driving differences among habitats in all three locations, but only between MH1 and MH2. That there were no other strong consistent differences between the different microhabitats in terms of the measured properties of the sediments indicates that there is more driving these patterns than a simple relationship to different habitat formed by mangrove forests and/or feedbacks between sediment properties and benthos. With respect to the benthic assemblage, in all bays MH1 and MH3 were the most different. The benthos showed stronger patterns relating to the different subhabitats than did the sediment, suggesting that there are important differences affecting these habitats that were not revealed by our suite of biogeochemical measurements of the sediment. © 2007 The Authors.;2007;2023-07-04 07:38:08;2024-04-15 07:20:38;;775-788;;7;32;;Austral Ecol.;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"macrofauna; Mangrove forest; ecosystem function; benthos; spatial variation; Macrofauna; sediment; mangrove; Australia; Sediment; microhabitat; biogeochemistry; temporal variation; mangrove forest; ecosystem structure; New South Wales; Australasia; Animalia; Sydney Harbour; sediment property; Biogeochemical; Structure and functioning; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; SPECIES RICHNESS; INTERTIDAL SEDIMENTS; MARINE-SEDIMENTS; SPATIAL VARIATION; SOFT SEDIMENTS; LEAF-LITTER; TAXONOMIC RESOLUTION; biogeochemical; EROSION THRESHOLD; MICROPHYTOBENTHIC CHLOROPHYLL-A; structure and functioning; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the degree of influence of the engineer will vary significantly as it grows, matures and senesces, and surprisingly little is known about how the influence of an ecosystem engineer varies with ontogeny. We address this issue on the tidal flats of San Francisco Bay where hybrid Spartina (foliosa × alterniflora) invaded 30 years ago. The invasion has altered the physico-chemical properties of the sediment habitat, which we predicted should cause changes in macrofaunal community structure and function. Through mensurative and manipulative approaches we investigated the influence of different growth stages of hybrid Spartina on macrobenthos and the underlying mechanisms. Cross-elevation sampling transects were established covering 5 zones (or stages) of the invasion, running from the tidal flat (pre-invasion) to an unvegetated dieback zone. Additionally, we experimentally removed aboveground plant structure in the mature (inner) marsh to mimic the 'unvegetated areas'. Our results revealed four distinct faunal assemblages, which reflected Spartina-induced changes in the corresponding habitat properties along an elevation gradient: a pre-invaded tidal flat, a leading edge of immature invasion, a center of mature invasion, and a senescing dieback area. These stages of hybrid Spartina invasion were accompanied by a substantial reduction in macrofaunal species richness and an increase in dominance, as well as a strong shift in feeding modes, from surface microalgal feeders to subsurface detritus/Spartina feeders (mainly tubificid oligochaetes and capitellid polychaetes). Knowledge of the varying influence of plant invaders on the sediment ecosystem during different phases of invasion is critical for management of coastal wetlands. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.;2007;2023-07-04 07:38:10;2024-04-15 07:43:27;;975-993;;8;9;;Biol.

Increased prevalence of anthropogenic changes to assemblages of habitat-forming species prompts questions about the importance of facilitator biodiversity to associated organisms. We used observational and short-term (30 days) manipulative studies of an intertidal seaweed system to test for the implications of changes in four components of biodiversity (seaweed species richness, functional group richness, species composition, and functional group composition) on associated small mobile invertebrate epifauna. We found that invertebrate epifauna richness and abundance were not influenced by changes in seaweed biodiversity. Invertebrate assemblage structure was in most cases not influenced by changes in seaweed biodiversity; only when algal assemblages were composed of monocultures of species with 'foliose' morphologies did we observe a difference in invertebrate assemblage structure. Correlations between algal functional composition and invertebrate assemblage structure were observed, but there was no correlation between algal species composition and invertebrate assemblage structure. These results suggest that changes in seaweed biodiversity are likely to have implications for invertebrate epifauna only under specific scenarios of algal change. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we compare the epibionts of A. colbecki from three different areas, highlighting the importance of their shells as a natural secondary hard bottom for many taxa. In this way, we show that due to its ability to swim, the scallop may contribute to the dispersion of epibiotic species, and this probably increases their survival.

In San Francisco Bay, California, USA, marshes containing native California cordgrass (Spartina foliosa) are being invaded by a hybrid (S. alterniflora × S. foliosa) formed after introduction of S. alterniflora. This study compared vegetation, sediment structure, and infaunal invertebrates in native and invaded marshes. We hypothesized that differences in the physical structure between S. foliosa and hybrid Spartina would be reflected in differences in density, biomass, diversity, and taxonomic composition of infauna. Hybrid Spartina modifies habitat structure more than S. foliosa by producing taller stems, and greater plant biomass both above- and belowground while occupying a much wider tidal range, thereby transforming open mudflats to a vegetated habitat. In general, S. foliosa areas contained significantly higher densities of benthic infauna than adjacent mudflats, while hybrid Spartina areas never contained greater infaunal densities than mudflats. This is because S. foliosa produces a moderate level of structure that can facilitate benthic invertebrates, whereas hybrid Spartina produces so much structure, particularly belowground, that it actually excludes invertebrates. Therefore, we suggest that these two closely related species both act as ecosystem engineers, but with opposing effects on invertebrate communities. © Springer 2006.;2006;2023-07-04 07:38:13;2024-04-15 08:14:10;;683-695;;4;8;;Biol.

However, on tropical coral reefs, where scleractinian corals have long been recognized as important foundation species creating habitat and resources that are utilized by a diversity of taxa, such relationships have rarely been studied and never within the contemporary theoretical context of facilitation. In the present study, we surveyed coral reefs on the south coast of St. John, US Virgin Islands, with the goal of quantifying the relationship between 'coral traits' (3 distinctive characteristics of scleractinian communities) and the abundance and diversity of benthic invertebrates associated with the reefs. We defined coral traits as coral diversity, percentage cover of live coral, and the topographic complexity created by coral skeletons, and statistically evaluated their roles in accounting for the abundance and diversity of conspicuous invertebrates at 25 sites. The analysis yielded contrasting results in terms of the putative facilitative roles of scleractinian corals. Coral traits were significantly and positively related to the diversity of reef-associated invertebrates, but were not related to invertebrate abundance. Topographic complexity (but not coral cover) had relatively strong explanatory ability in accounting for the variation in invertebrate diversity, although a substantial fraction of the variance in invertebrate diversity (45%) remained unexplained. While these results are correlative, they demonstrate that a statistical majority of the variation in the diversity of conspicuous invertebrates on Caribbean reefs can be explained by the role of coral skeletons in creating topographic relief with diverse morphologies, although processes independent of coral traits also play important roles. In an era of globally declining coral cover, these findings suggest that the progressive loss of coral skeletons from tropical reefs will lead to substantial losses of invertebrate diversity that might initially be obscured by conserved abundances. © Inter-Research 2006.;2006;2023-07-04 07:38:14;2024-04-15 08:03:22;;117-127;;;319;;Mar.

To investigate the effects of Z. marina loss on the local fish assemblages, the fish fauna was compared between existing seagrass beds and sites where seagrass had vanished. A field study was carried out at four shallow locations in the outer archipelago of the coast in June 2004. Within each location two sites were sampled, one with an existing Z. marina bed and another where Z. marina had disappeared. Fish were sampled semi-quantitatively with a beach seine. Samples were taken during both day and night and captured fish were examined to species, enumerated and measured in the field, and released thereafter. The number of fish species was found to be significantly higher in Z. marina habitats compared to areas where seagrass was missing, and density and biomass of fish were generally lower in areas dominated by bare sediment compared to those in the seagrass habitats. Several species and groups of fishes (i.e., gadoids, labrids, syngnathids) were absent or occurred in low densities at sites where Z. marina was missing. For example, juvenile 0-group cod density was reduced by 96% at sites where Z. marina had disappeared. Such a reduction in recruitment of cod is in the same order of magnitude as the combined effect of seal predation and mortality due to by-catches in the eel fyke-net fishery estimated for the archipelago of the Swedish Skagerrak. Hence, the results clearly indicate a shift in the fish assemblage, including a loss of taxa at the family level as a result of degradation in habitat-forming vegetation. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we evaluate potential effects of large-scale disappearance of the dominant canopy-forming species Fucus vesiculosus L. on vegetation-associated invertebrates in the Baltic Sea. We compare the macroalgal and invertebrate assemblages between sites where F. vesiculosus has disappeared over a larger area and adjacent sites with intact Fucus vegetation. The species richness of animals did not differ between sites with and without F. vesiculosus and no species were clearly confined to sites with Fucus. However, total animal abundance and biomass were generally lower when F. vesiculosus was absent and the animal assemblage at sites without Fucus differed consistently from adjacent Fucus sites. Since the assemblage of epiphytic and turf-forming macroalgae also differed with the presence of Fucus, the differences in invertebrate assemblages can be explained either by direct effects of the Fucus plants or by altered abundance of other macroalgal species. Based on these observations we suggest that large-scale disappearance of F. vesiculosus in the Baltic Sea may result in a changed composition and biomass of vegetation-associated invertebrates, with potential effects on higher trophic levels. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the role played by biogenic habitats (Mytilus edulis and Crepidula spp. beds) in influencing the subtidal distribution (kilometers scale) of the mud crab Dyspanopeus sayi in Narragansett Bay, New England (USA). In field surveys, D. sayi were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude more abundant on M. edulis and Crepidula spp. beds than at sites lacking these habitats, and a laboratory experiment confirmed that D. sayi will consume both of these species. In a field-based, substrate-choice experiment, modules containing rocks had higher D. sayi recruit densities than those containing M. edulis or Crepidula spp. This indicates that structural complexity of those biogenic substrates, rather than their availability as prey, is the primary factor influencing patterns of D. sayi recruitment. Densities of recruit and adult D. sayi on recruitment modules were higher at bare sites than at sites with biogenic habitat, where modules represented islands of structure in otherwise simple habitat. This suggests small-scale habitat selection by D. sayi. Adult D. sayi occupied modules indiscriminately at bare sites, but exhibited a preference for modules containing mussels at sites with biogenic habitats. The importance of structure for adult and recruit D. sayi, reinforced by adults' response to prey presence, likely explains this organism's association with hard, biogenic habitats in the studied system. © Inter-Research 2006.;2006;2023-07-04 07:38:16;2024-04-15 07:57:52;;223-231;;;306;;Mar.

In this study, we evaluated the contribution of mussels (Brachidontes rodriguezii, Mytilus edulis platensis, and Perna perna) to the benthic species richness of intertidal and shallow subtidal communities at Cerro Verde (Uruguay). We compared the richness of macro-benthic species between mussel-engineered patches and patches without mussels but dominated by algae or barnacles at a landscape scale (all samples), between tidal levels, and between sites distributed along a wave exposition gradient. Overall, we found a net increase in species richness in samples with mussels (35 species), in contrast to samples where mussels were naturally absent or scarce (27 species). The positive trend of the effect did not depend upon tidal level or wave exposition, but its magnitude varied between sites. Within sites, a significant positive effect was detected only at the protected site. Within the mussel-engineered patches, the richness of all macro-faunal groups (total, sessile and mobile) was positively correlated with mussel abundance. This evidence indicates that the mussel beds studied here were important in maintaining species richness at the landscape-level, and highlights that beds of shelled bivalves should not be neglected as conservation targets in marine benthic environments. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Here, we suggest that managers can use the diversity of species in an area and the presence of foundation species as two indicators of marine ecosystem functioning. We used data from the 2006 sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) test fishery in the inside waters of southeastern Alaska to evaluate the relationship between the diversity of fish species present in an area and the abundance of both target and total fish caught. We found that areas where more fish species were present were characterized by higher catch levels of both sablefish and total fish, suggesting that diversity may be a reasonable indicator of fishery yields and productivity. Furthermore, because the incidence of deep-water coral was also logged in the surveys, we explored the relationship between coral, which provides habitat for groundfish, and catch levels. We found that abundances were highest where coral was present. Finally, we conducted meta-analyses of the importance of marine foundation species, such as corals, kelps, seagrasses, and oyster reefs, in promoting the diversity and abundance of associated taxa and found that diversity was 1.4-fold higher and abundances were 3.4-fold higher where these habitat-forming species were present. Together, these results suggest that biodiversity and the presence of foundation species can serve as useful indicators of a marine ecosystem's ability to provide the goods, services, and functions that we and other organisms rely on. We therefore suggest that these indicators be incorporated into fisheries management strategies.;2007;2023-07-04 07:38:18;2024-04-15 07:46:32;;82-91;;;48;;;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"Laminariales; Anthozoa; Ostreidae; Anoplopoma fimbria; Anoplopomatidae; KELP FORESTS; DISTURBANCE; ABUNDANCE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; FISH ASSEMBLAGES; RECRUITMENT; POSITIVE INTERACTIONS; LIFE-HISTORY; BIODIVERSITY LOSS; HABITAT COMPLEXITY; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The epiphytic community of F. evanescens in southern Sweden was compared with that of the native Fucus vesiculosus, to examine to what extent an invading seaweed can modify local biodiversity. F. evanescens was much less fouled than F. vesiculosus, supporting both less biomass and fewer species of epiphytes. Multivariate analysis of the most common epiphyte taxa showed that the epiphytic community composition of F. evanescens was not entirely separated from that of F. vesiculosus, but host species contributed significantly to explain the variation in community composition. The biomass of free-living invertebrates was also lower on F. evanescens, although the pattern differed between taxonomic groups. While the biomass of amphipods was lower on F. evanescens, there was no significant difference in biomass of isopods or gastropods between the Fucus species. The good correlation between biomass of epiphytes and free-living animals suggests that the epiphytes play an important role in providing a suitable habitat for many species of free-living epifauna. The study shows that the invasion of F. evanescens affects the environmental conditions for many species associated with the Fucus community but that the direct effect on biodiversity is probably low.;2004;2023-07-04 07:38:18;2024-04-15 09:08:08;;141-150;;2;6;;Biol.

On rocky shores inside Antofagasta Bay (Northern Chile), the alien ascidian Pyura praeputialis, an engineer species, creates broad belts and dense 3-dimensional matrices that modify the intertidal habitat structure. In all, 116 species of macro-invertebrates and algae inhabit this habitat, compared with the 66 species inhabiting adjacent intertidal rocky shores which lack P. praeputialis. Of the 145 species recorded at the seascape scale (encompassing both mid-intertidal habitat), 55 % were found exclusively in intertidal P. praeputialis matrices. Along the coastal gradient, patterns in β-diversity emerge due to the addition of a new set of species to the community inhabiting the P. praeputialis matrices and, to a lesser extent, from spatial turnover. We found differences in the shape of the species frequency distribution between the communities inhabiting the engineered and non-engineered mid-intertidal habitats. However, within the same habitat type, there was no difference in the species frequency distribution between functional groups. Occurrence of macro-algae was not affected by habitat type, but occurence of macro-invertebrates increased significantly in P. praeputialis matrices. P. praeputialis increases species richness at local and seascape scales by providing a novel mid-intertidal habitat which is used by mobile and vagile macro-invertebrates that otherwise would remain excluded from this intertidal level.;2004;2023-07-04 07:38:19;2024-04-15 09:19:08;;119-130;;;268;;Mar.

The space between barnacles and ascidians is filled with muddy sediment inhabited by motile taxa. We hypothesized that (i) epibenthic patches and unstructured sediment would attract different motile fauna and (ii) motile fauna of the patches would be affected by local abundances of epibenthic foundation species. Most dominant motile species demonstrated a significant difference in abundance between the two microhabitats. In contrast to the fauna of the sediment, species composition observed in aggregations of barnacles and ascidians was stable across different locations. In the field experiment initially clear bivalve shells after 5 years of exposure developed barnacle clusters with motile fauna similar to that observed in natural aggregations. Amphipods, isopods and bivalves, capitellid polychaets, Cirratulus cirratus (Müller) and Pholoe minuta Fabricius (Polychaeta) dominated in the sediment inside epibenthic patches. The proportion of capitellids, known to be sensitive to organic enrichment, was much higher within the patches than outside. The abundances of motile taxa found in aggregations were mostly determined by the number of barnacles of different size and of their empty shells, the biomass of ascidians, and the effect of location. Different dominant species demonstrated sensitivity to different parameters. Physical structure of the habitat, provided by barnacles and ascidians, as well as their biodeposition activity are regarded as the main factors structuring the motile fauna in the community studied. The spatial pattern observed seems to imply a range of pattern-generating biogenic processes, similar to those previously revealed in patches of filter-feeding bivalves, tube-building worms and seagrass. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This multivariate and multitable method enabled the correlation of three types of benthic characteristics (mineral substratum, coverage of structural species and large echinoderms) with butterflyfish abundances in two bays of the urban centre of Nouméa (New Caledonia). The first concordance axis was related to a gradient in the coverage of branching corals. This disturbance gradient compared damaged reef areas dominated by long-spined sea urchins to areas with an extensive coverage of branching corals. The abundance of corallivorous chaetodontids was related to this gradient, supporting the view of corals as a food and shelter source for these fishes. The second concordance axis was interpreted as a gradient of heterogeneity in the coverage of benthic life-forms. The abundance of omnivorous chaetodontids was related to this gradient. Thus, the concordance axes defined two key components of habitat structure that were related to the entire fish community structure. © 2005 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.;2005;2023-07-04 07:38:22;2024-04-15 08:21:18;;966-982;;4;66;;J.

Habitat use patterns for striped bass in relation to biogenic habitat types in Chesapeake Bay tributaries are poorly described although it is widely acknowledged that these piscivorous fishes use estuarine habitat for nursery and feeding grounds during development. Striped bass diet and distribution patterns were examined in relation to a gradient of biogenic habitats ranging from complex three-dimensional oyster reef through flat oyster bar to sand bottom habitat in the Piankatank River, Virginia. Striped bass were more abundant at both sites with oysters and oyster shell substrate than at the site with sand substrate. Striped bass in association with the three-dimensional oyster reef were larger and consumed more teleosts (e.g., naked gobies) than fish at either of the non-reef sites. Striped bass estuarine habitat use is positively correlated with the presence of oyster reef habitat that includes physical structure and food resources via complex trophic communities centered on the oyster reef.;2003;2023-07-04 07:38:23;2024-04-15 09:19:44;;841-851;;3;72;;Bull.

Biogenic habitat has regenerated in localised patches on the dredge-modified seafloor. We sampled the macrofauna on five of these habitats with differing complexity and tested the hypothesis that the macrofauna assemblage composition differed between habitats and the difference conformed to a seriation with increasing complexity. The results of multivariate analyses supported the hypothesis and allowed for the postulation of a model of macrofaunal assemblage succession and biogenic habitat regeneration in Foveaux Strait. The extent of habitat regeneration appears to largely depend both on the time since fishing ceased and on the proximity of the sources of re-colonising propagules. Oyster density rebuilt to relatively high densities in habitat that had not fully regenerated. The results of the study suggest specific habitat conservation strategies that could benefit the sustainable management of the oyster fishery of Foveaux Strait. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In the Mediterranean, low-shore habitats are often monopolised by canopy algae of the genus Cystoseira and, in particular, by the species Cystoseira amentacea var. stricta. Alternatively, low-shore habitats are dominated by turf-forming algae and/or mussels. Previous studies showed that loss of Cystoseira, by natural or anthropogenic disturbances, resulted in the increase of turfing algae. Here, we propose that turf-forming algae may act as colonisers from nearby habitats, specifically from lower portions of the shore. The following hypotheses were tested to investigate this proposition: (1) in presence of Cystoseira, the assemblage living under its canopy will be distinct, in terms of composition and structure, from that found lower on the shore, (2) if the canopy of Cystoseira was removed, the differences between the two assemblages would decrease or disappear, (3) the effects of the canopy would be more important than other causes of variability at the spatial scale investigated (hundreds to thousands of metres), and (4) that effects of removal of the canopy would be consistent through time. These hypotheses were tested by means of a canopy removal experiment, involving several spatial and temporal repetitions of the manipulation. The assemblage underneath the canopy of Cystoseira was distinct from that found immediately lower on the shore, but when the canopy was removed there were no differences between the two. The effects of the canopy were consistent at the spatial and temporal scales investigated. Several species living under the canopy disappeared and were replaced by turf-forming species, resulting in a homogenisation of the two habitats and in a drastic loss of habitat diversity. This study shows that Cystoseira can be considered a habitat-forming species, responsible for the maintenance of two distinct low-shore assemblages. In this light, its importance should be taken into account by policies aiming to preserve biodiversity on rocky shores. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this article, I use a 19-year-long kelp forest-monitoring data set from the Channel Islands National Park (a) to identify associations between subtidal species and forested or deforested habitats, (b) to generate an idealized food web for Southern California giant kelp forests in order to identify the primary conduits of energy flow through the system, and (c) to determine changes in the diversity and complexity of this food web due to localized giant kelp deforestation. A total of 275 common species were observed in the park between 1982 and 2000, of which 36% occurred significantly more often in kelp-forested areas than in deforested areas (that is, sea urchin barrens); 25 species were found exclusively in forested areas. Most of these associations were clearly identified as trophic and/or structural associations with giant kelp itself. The producer level of the food web was diverse, although giant kelp apparently represents the greatest single source of fixed carbon through either direct grazing or the production of phytodetritus. Primary, secondary and tertiary consumer levels were also represented by numerous species, and generalist consumers were common. With deforestation, the source of primary production shifts from primarily kelps to ephemeral microalgae, macroalgae, and phytoplankton.

However, experimental manipulation of the habitat provides a more unequivocal estimate of its importance. In this study we quantified how fish communities on small patch reefs covaried with changes in benthic cover habitat features. A random sample of small patch reefs was selected and both fish abundance and habitat measures recorded. Naturally occurring patch reefs could be classed into three habitat types based on their benthic cover. Reefs dominated by massive soft corals were the most abundant (50%), followed by those dominated by rock and soft corals in equal proportions (36%), then reefs dominated by branching corals (14%). Fish assemblages differed between the reef types. Communities on soft-coral-dominated and rock/soft-coral-dominated patch reefs formed a continuum of species responses correlated with degree of soft coral cover. In contrast, branching-coral-dominated reefs were occupied by a more discrete set of species. We tested the role of soft corals in contributing to this pattern by experimentally reducing soft coral cover on patch reefs from a baseline level of ∼67% to ∼33% and ∼6%, and monitoring the experiment over 2 years. Contrary to expectations derived from the correlative data, and in contrast with previous manipulations of hard corals, soft-coral disturbance did not generate any corresponding changes in the fish assemblage. This ""negative"" result indicated that the quality and heterogeneity of habitat generated by soft corals on patch reefs was indistinguishable from equivalent-sized habitat patches formed by bare rock alone. Nevertheless, because soft corals are living organisms they have the potential to generate indirect effects by interacting with other organisms such as hard corals. In the long-term, we hypothesize that biotic interactions between habitat forming organisms might affect composition of fish assemblages on patch reefs.";2001;2023-07-04 07:38:31;2024-04-15 09:24:37;;560-571;;4;127;;Oecologia;;;;;;;;English;;;Scopus;;;;;;;"habitat structure; disturbance; reef fish; Disturbance; Reef fish; coral reef; community composition; habitat association; soft coral; Habitat association; Soft corals; ichthyofauna; interspecific interaction; COMMUNITIES; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; DISTURBANCE; HABITAT STRUCTURE; RECRUITMENT; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; PREDATION; OCTOCORALLIA; RED-SEA; soft corals; ALCYONACEA; done; verified";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These structures represent ecological islands hosting a different and often more diverse and abundant community than surrounding sandflats. However, few studies have been carried out on tube aggregations of the polychaete Lanice conchilega, although its tube tops are conspicuous habitat features on European intertidal coasts with densities reaching several thousand per m2. The aim of this study was to determine differences between benthic communities associated with tube aggregations and tubefree areas, and to investigate the longevity of community patterns around L. conchilega tubes. From 1995 to 2000, the L. conchilega population of an intertidal sandflat off the Eastern Friesian coast was sampled annually. Multivariate analysis showed significant differences between the L. conchilega and reference communities. Species diversity and abundance were higher among tube aggregations. This pattern developed rapidly after L. conchilega colonisation but was also readily destroyed, mainly due to dynamic changes of the L. conchilega population. Five species of benthic macrofauna were exclusively found among L. conchilega tubes, and four species were more abundant in tube aggregations than in reference areas. Only one species, the polychaete Aphelochaeta marioni, was found in lower numbers in dense L. conchilega aggregations. Hence, it is concluded that L. conchilega is a habitat engineer, which alters the composition of the benthic community and contributes to its patchy distribution pattern. However, this pattern is dynamic and ephemeral. Effects of tube aggregations depend on the population dynamic of L. conchilega itself and the species composition in the surrounding sands. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here I demonstrate the importance of this alteration on sedimentary properties and resident macrofaunal assemblages of a tidal flat in Mission Bay, San Diego, California, USA, where the mussel is exotic. In well-developed mats, percent fine sediments, percent combustible organic matter, and sediment shear strengths were increased relative to adjacent areas without mats. Comparisons of naturally occurring areas with and without mats of M. senhousia, as well as comparisons of the same tidal flat when mussels were seasonally present and absent, revealed that assemblages within mussel mats differ from those in sediment without mats. The primary effect of the mussel and its mats was facilitation of other organisms. Total densities of all macrofaunal individuals as well as species richness were typically higher inside than outside mussel mats. Two species that exhibited large enhancements of densities within mussel mats were the tanaid Leptochelia dubia and the gastropod Barleeia subtenuis. Oligochaetes, a numerically important component of the tidal flat, appear least facilitated by the presence of mats. A short-term, manipulative experiment that examined the effects of mussel mat mimics on the colonization of macrofauna suggested that the presence of physical structure alone can produce several of the patterns observed in naturally occurring mussel mats. These results highlight that alteration of habitats is an important effect of exotic species, and that these habitat alterations can have subsequent effects on resident biotic communities.;1998;2023-07-04 07:38:35;2024-04-17 06:36:58;;137-152;;;162;;Mar.

Tube-dwelling polychaetes provide one of the main features in the otherwise relatively low structured sandy intertidal. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the tube-dwelling sand-mason Lanice conchilega on macrofauna and nematodes in an intertidal sandflat in the Wadden Sea area off the German coast. Field studies and experiments were carried out on the associated macrobenthic fauna of natural L. conchilega aggregates and of artificial tubes. Furthermore, the distribution of nematode species at increasing distances along transects arising from individual L. conchilega tubes, was investigated. Natural as well as artificial tubes had positive effects on numbers of macrofaunal species and individuals. Yet, juvenile Mya arenaria were the only species appearing in higher numbers in both L. conchilega aggregates and artificial tube fields. They used the tube structure to attach themselves with their byssus threads. The polychaete Malmgreniella lunulata only occurred in natural L. conchilega aggregates and was often found inside the polychaetes' tubes. It is possibly a commensal associated to L. conchilega. In artificial tube fields, opportunistic spionids and Capitella capitata settled in higher numbers. This might be due to colonisation of sediment accumulating in the tube fields, utilisation of the tubes as an attachment surface or refuge from predation. However, two predatory polychaetes, Eteone longa and Nereis diversicolor, were also found in higher abundance in natural or artificial tube fields. Nematode abundances were considerably higher next to individual L. conchilega tubes at a distance of 0.5 cm. This distribution was mainly caused by a group of threadlike species with a thin cuticle, which are thought to be adapted to epidermal uptake of dissolved organic matter. It is suggested that there might be a linkage between predatory polychaetes and the distribution pattern found for nematodes around the tubes of L. conchilega.;1998;2023-07-04 07:38:36;2024-04-17 06:29:48;;131-138;;1-6;29;;Senckenb.

In this investigation, we assessed the function of the alga dominating rocky reefs in temperate Australia and New Zealand, Hormosira banksii. Invertebrate and algal species assemblages were examined within areas of full H. banksii canopy, areas where it was naturally patchy or absent (within its potential range on the shore) and areas where the intact canopy was experimentally disturbed. Differences in species assemblages were detected between areas with natural variation in H. banksii cover (full, patchy, negligible), with defined species associated with areas of full cover. Differences were also detected between experimentally manipulated and naturally patchy areas of canopy cover. Species assemblages altered in response to canopy manipulations and did not recover even twelve months after initial sampling. Both light intensity and temperature were buffered by full canopies compared to patchy canopies and exposed rock. This study allows us to predict the consequences to the intertidal community due to the loss of canopy cover, which may result from a range of disturbances such as trampling, storm damage, sand burial and prolonged exposure to extreme temperature, and further allow for improved management of this key autogenic ecosystem engineer.;2019-05;2024-09-24 08:33:30;2024-09-24 08:33:30;2024-09-24 08:33:30;79;;5;11;;;;;;;;;;en;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/;;;;www.mdpi.com;;Number: 5 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute;;;;"/unread; disturbance; facilitation; intertidal reef; invertebrates; macroalgae";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
