You can find in this project, within the folder 00_DATA, the review grid used to systematically score the articles in the corpus.

The folder 01_SCRIPT contains the R script used for graphical and statistical representations based on the review grid. Please note that the aesthetics of the figures have been enhanced using Inkscape, especially for Figure 7.
